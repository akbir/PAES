nalani and
i walk
to our
small community
garden plot
in manoa -- 
the seed
packets in
my pocket
sound like
a baby's
toy rattle -- 
when do
they spray
glyphosate along
the sidewalks?
from kunia
to waimea,
fifty thousand
acres of
gmo fields -- 
how will
open air
pesticide drift
affect our
unborn daughter,
whose nerve
endings are
just beginning
to root? -- 
we plant
seeds in
rows, soil
gathers under
our fingernails -- 
syngenta, dupont,
dow, pioneer,
basf, monsanto
$240 million
seed sector -- 
corn for
cattle feed
and syrup -- 
runoff turns
[our] streams
red -- poisons
lo'i -- 50,000
heart sea
urchins die off -- 
what will
our daughter
be able
to plant
in this
paradise of
fugitive dust --

last night
locked in
the castle
of pride and
egotism
goes on two
              Webern
orchestrated a
sky the clouds
move to a
an instrument not
an oboe, gray
on light-gray in
blue and green
goes by
on glass
              Schoenberg
serenades with
a view through
to where
a girl
swings
body displaced
against the
pull of her
hands head-
high on the
              night
before the night
before last
unlocked the castle
of pride and
egotism
              bliss
clouds stand
and go by

greetings
as the door opened
ticking
please listen to this
food alone for all
the f.b.i. will continue
maybe you dozed off
i hung by that phone all night
suppose he talks
once upon a time
not looking for any thing
you're on
your own
it's off
it's on
perhaps it means
ragged like that
golda my-yeer
         pre-meer
and pour the old box
down a drain
too  much news
said the news
r e  o l e
it's us
or rust
listener
personal
regret
looking
monday
we can save
your head or your body
we can shave
his admission
a subtle lie
in suspense
what is cut into
the smallest of the
grinding
to fill
a prescription
drum to the wobble and a roll on the sea
come to mind an article of light
distance through distance unfinished
willing to believe
national
anthem
hearer
perfect rhyme to some
all cars
kept in doors
sophisticated
newsmen
show how
it could have been
retreat
from the swiss
legation
numbers
for an event
corruption
why not?
infinite
detail
is no more real
thought
             against
                          power
answer
hooked
to just another
piece of tape
hooked
to just one more
little piece of tape
through words in to
record
writer
righter
on replay?
all you
expand
the system
a polaroid
with the wrong
voice print
astronaut
amazed
at what
was expected

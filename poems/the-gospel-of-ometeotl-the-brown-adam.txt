Jasmine garlands thin
             for the rib's cartilage ring.
The heart shudders with pure mission.
                                                         She spreads
                                                         & knows herself as Adam,
                                                         Ometeotl,
                                                         but through himself,
                                                         Omecihuatl,
                                                         he is Eve.
            He knows but what the garden gives:
                        the garden's soot
                        awakened tongueless in root.
            Cerise chrysantha
                        coils around his leg.
            Gathering the tides
                                    of the seas to his side,
                                    she conceives
                                    where impossibilities seed.
            Clarity burning coal,                he takes two knots
                                                of grass
                                                & strings
                        four birds-of-paradise
            through the ceiba's rotted leaves:
                                    she fashions the sorrows
                                    from winter's purse,
                                    sea
                                    & sun
                                    sifted for sum.
                        Entrammeled, Ometeotl rises
                                    one among one
                        body stitched in strange altar.

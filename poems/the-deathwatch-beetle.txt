A cardinal hurls itself
at my window all morning long,   
trying so hard to penetrate
its own reflection
I almost let it in myself,
though once I saw   
another red bird, crazed
by the walls of a room,   
spatter its feathers   
all over the house.
My whole childhood is coming apart,   
the last stitches
about to be ripped out
with your death,
and I will be left--ridiculous,
to write
condolence letters
to myself.

of insects
but simply because of the sound   
it makes, ticking.

Or is it even now battering   
against your thin skull, wild   
to get through, blood brother   
to this crimson bird?

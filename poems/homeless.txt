My son lives on the streets.
We don't see each other much.
Like a mother who puts white lilies
on the headstone of a dead child,
I put money into his bank account,
clothes into E-Z Access storage
and pretend he's far away--
at a boarding school, or in a foreign country.
Nights, I dream fairy tales about him.
I dream he becomes a prince,
scholar or warrior who rescues me
from sorrow, the way he rescued me
when he was a child and said,
"Mommy, don't cry," and brought tea
into the room of his father's acrimony--
brave, standing tall in the forest
fire of his father's scorn. I wake
to the empty sound of wind in the trees.
He says he wants to live with me.
I say I can't live with him--
boy whose words crash like branches in a rain storm.
Nothing can hold him in,
the walls of a house too thin.
Back home, I had seen
the "study-hard-so-you-don't-become-like-them"
street bums on Mamo Street,
and he's like them.
These days, in order to catch a glimpse of him,
I circle the city. One day,
I see him on his bike.
People give him wide berth,
the same way birds avoid power lines,
oncoming cars or trees.
I park on a side street.
Wild-eyed, he flies the block
as if in a holding pattern.
Not of my body, not of my hopes,
he homes in on what can't be given or taken away.

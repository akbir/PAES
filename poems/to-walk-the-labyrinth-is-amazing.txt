Everything looped, spiraled, circular (thought)
But the labyrinth's not a maze but a singular way
to strike "the profoundest chord"
across aspire
Those who enter the labyrinth can leave
(pilgrims sometime don't)
(Elle did not)
Inside the largest circle
(the labyrinth itself)
splits into equal parts
(demi-arcs or waves)
No, silly, Elle whispers, petals
          If measured through the centre of the petals there should be two parts for each
          petal and one for the entry, but calculations from the measurements show that
          this is not so. The difference is about  1/2 ". There is no way around this problem.
We must seek a solution
to the geometry of petals,
the consequential mystery
of Elle's message:
I was sick and am not
healed.     I am not blind
but dead.     I am not dead
but silenced.     Alone, in love.

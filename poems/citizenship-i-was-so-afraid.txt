I was so afraid. I couldn’t escape it. It was bigger than me and 3 horned. It dashed for me and missed and missed again. It leapt for me in my skirt. I was younger than it. It opened its parent mouth and I could die trying.

It would never never miss me.
It would stand on its two legs
and I was its message.

Running hands over this country’s pantalones.

I’m still surprised by our hulking silhouette.

Our hopeful investments and slightly whiny children.

Pompous jars of mustard in the fridge.

We as blunt as gum

under tables in restaurants.

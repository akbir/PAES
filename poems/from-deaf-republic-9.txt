I am not a poet, Sonya I inspect
the fragrant feet of younger ladies--
While deafness hums as a little motor
I watch her stand in the shower
holding her breasts
in her hands like two small explosions.
I am her boy drowning.
In this country he does not know
the word for "drowning" and yells:
"I am diving for the last time!"

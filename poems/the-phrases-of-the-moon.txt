            the blow to a gong
--gone blind
           
            with the sight of white
Silk, O milk
            of my reason--
           
            sun reseen in
My mad mad mirror.
           
Gibbous
Less science: the
Wish-apparition of a perfect fact.
            As thought, the war
Of one upon one.
Half a mind almost mine.
             fragment, I am
A being from another word.
Crescent
Bow bent back--to what release?
            My lone line, the join of all I am not.
A minor truth betrays
A major one--
A lore
            for the lyre.
For it is written: liar with a why.
            Calling all coincidence, I will
Deem the dark my day.
Yet--if I say
            I am lying, I am lying
To you now.
O zero raised to zero--I am lying with you now.

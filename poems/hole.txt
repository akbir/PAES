dis suit of clothes jus as empty
as a sky wid no stars
two years a workin   savin money
den   john drop out my heart
i dont want ta see his wife
i knows dat she is me
i'se could go in   shootin de rifle
let my angry run free
bes not   just my temper risin
no use stoking dead fire
but ta see his face one mo time
now lord   jus you on high
if he make do widout me now
i can make do lord   i can make do

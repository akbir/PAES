The eater, my birthmother, was speaking:
I can't tell you his name. You have to promise me you won't look for him. He's not a nice man.
Agitated, frenetic, the eater falling into her own waters.
Sobbing, almost wailing.
She said:
I'm so ashamed. I'm sorry. It was one night.
I was swirling into the streambed,
lost in the downstream plunge.
I said:
Can you just tell me his name? I won't look for him.
The eater filled with water, driving
toward the boulder's edge.
I rocked:
into the lava break, into the fault.

When in the dumps, I hate the things
   That ordinarily I love.
I loathe the lark that blindly sings;
   I hate the bland, blue sky above.
The crocus, sneering on the lawn,
   Forsythia about to bloom--
I'd like to see them dead and gone,
   Instead of filling life with gloom.
But most of all, I do not care,
   While I am droning in my hive,
To hear vivacious chums declare
   How great it is to be alive.

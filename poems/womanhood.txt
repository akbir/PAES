When I was three,
a tsunami hit town.
"Daddy, Daddy, save me,
don't let me drown."
He saved me
and my common-type dolls.
When I was sixteen,
another tsunami hit town.
I cried to my daddy,
"Daddy, Daddy, please save me,
don't let me drown!"
But he let go of my hand!
I still dance
to what broke on my life.

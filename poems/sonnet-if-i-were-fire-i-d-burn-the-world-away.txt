                                Angiolieri's "S'i' fosse foco"
If I were fire, I'd burn the world away; 
If I were wind, I'd blow it down; 
If I were water, I'd let it drown; 
If I were God, I'd deep-six it today.
If I were Pope, what would make me gay? 
To ransack every Christian town. 
If I were emperor, what would make my day? 
To see heads roll on the ground!
If I were death, I'd run down my father; 
If I were life, I'd flee from him. 
As for dear mama, she gets the same. 
If I were Cecco, and that is my name, 
I'd take the pretty young girls to screw 
and leave the ugly old hags to you.

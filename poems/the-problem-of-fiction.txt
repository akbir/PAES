She always writes poems. This summer
she's starting a novel. It's in trouble already.   
The characters are easy--a girl
and her friend who is a girl
and the boy down the block with his first car,   
an older boy, sixteen, who sometimes
these warm evenings leaves his house to go dancing   
in dressy clothes though it's still light out.   
The girl has a brother who has lots of friends,   
is good in math, and just plain good which   
doesn't help the story. The story
should have rescues & escapes in it
which means who's the bad guy; he couldn't be   
the brother or the grandpa or the father either,
or even the boy down the block with his first car.   
People in novels have to need something,
she thinks, that it takes about
two hundred pages to get.
She can't imagine that. Nothing
she needs can be got; if it could
she'd go get it: the answer to nightmares;
a mother who'd be proud of her; doing things   
a mother could be proud of; having hips
& knowing how to squeal at the beach laughing
when the boy down the block picked her up & carried her   
& threw her in the water. If she'd laughed   
squealing he might still take her swimming   
& his mother wouldn't say she's crazy, she would   
not have got her teeth into his shoulder till   
well yes she bit him, and the marks
lasted & lasted, his mother said so,   
but that couldn't be in a novel.
She'll never squeal laughing, she'd never
not bite him, she hates cute girls, she hates   
boys who like them. Biting is embarrassing
and wrong & she has no intention of doing it again   
but she would if he did if he dared,
and there's no story if there's no hope of change.

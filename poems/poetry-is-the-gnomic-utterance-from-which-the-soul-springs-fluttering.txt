At the podium
measured and grave as a metronome
the (white, male) poet with bald-
gleaming head broods in gnom-
ic syllables on the death
of 12-year-old (black, male) Tamir Rice
shot in a park
by a Cleveland police officer
claiming to believe
the boy's plastic pistol
was a "real gun"
like his own eager
to discharge and slay
while twelve feet away at the edge of the bright-lit stage the (white, female) interpreter signing for the deaf is stricken with emotion -- horror, pity, disbelief -- outrage, sorrow -- young-woman face contorted and eyes spilling tears like Tamir Rice's mother perhaps, or the sister made to witness the child's bleeding out in the Cleveland park. We stare as the interpreter's fingers pluck the poet's words out of the air like bullets, break open stanzas tight as conches with the deft ferocity of a cormo- rant and render gnome-speech raw as hurt, as harm, as human terror wet-eyed and mouth-grimaced in horror's perfect O.

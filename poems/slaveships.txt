loaded like spoons
into the belly of Jesus
where we lay for weeks for months
in the sweat and stink
of our own breathing
why do you not protect us
chained to the heart of the Angel
where the prayers we never tell
and hot and red
as our bloody ankles
can these be men
who vomit us out from ships
called Jesus    Angel    Grace of God
onto a heathen country
ever again
can this tongue speak
can these bones walk
Grace Of God
can this sin live

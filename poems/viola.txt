Under Venus the sugared wound, the heart-strung-up, the viola d'amore. Under Venus the Pliny-prescribed, the horsehair-hanked -- not plucked, tugged -- the singly sung (catgut kidney-cuffs the caterwaul, a knockback to the viola bastarda). Kittenish! A scalloped flirtatious border -- florid cordial pansies (candied adoration). Viola odorata. Parfait d'Amourish.

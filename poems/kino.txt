your black inscriptions cite a kino lau,
whose feathered wingspan, nighttime eyes & pun-
ishing beak comprise mo'oku'auhau.
w/my oiled hands, I greet her, w/hun-
gering for mo'opuna. "mai," she says,
reciting from your thigh. "mai, mai e 'ai."
I have traveled from Maui a lizard, mes-
merized by dreams of 'ohi'a & ai-
kane, lizard filled w/smoke. arrived, I eat
transforming in the forest of your grand-
mother's memory: from lizard: woman
dreaming: licking tattoo: permission land:
skin. traveling the night of your kino
to sleep your thighs, ho'ao, ho'ao, and wake.

I here I'm here I'm here I'm here here here here cricket pulse -- the katydidic tick (and then a pause) tick (and then a pause) in greening trees -- tales of a gratitude for water, the hollyhock's trumpet Yes, Tenderness her glove and hoe -- her bad trip love/grief, her medic tent talking me down, kissed fissures in the world's despair, what I'd loved -- alive for a while -- a day called Rip and Brood, a day called Glorious Hour, the long hunt and the worm found in the battered petunias -- every morning in summer that last summer before the bees collapsed and the seas rose up to say Fuck You II perplexed by how it hadn't been unfailingly compatible, our being numerous -- how half the time we couldn't see the shapes we were supposed to make made grave our disasters -- a god's glass bearing down to burn the wheat crop -- to keep time alive inside a tomato, splicing fish into fruit -- some wanted to defy limitation were offered famine bric-a-brac townships virtual cities where you could stand in market aisles still expecting cherries III his rhythms were your rhythms Murray the cat -- sleeping a deux draped your length from hip to knee like a scabbard -- unsheathed his yawn tortured finches for breakfast yowled and yowled round the ravaged bowl till you fed him chicken from your own plate another mouth pearling the wheel of appetite, coveting a bloody mash to keep it going -- such a dumb rondeau who invented it! eating to live to kill to eat, even cat on a stick when fields failed, no crave for rain against the blasted scape nor love nor god at the end of my hours, but garlic and butter a splash of cognac steak frites IV and when soil burned and order failed and dogs then people starved in char I remembered an extraordinary peace, the privilege of   being left alone with bread to eat and famous butter "the chefs use," the venues of white sleep, cannabis and Klonopin the soma-goods of art and when my back went up against a blackened wall for rumored beans in dented cans I forgot my body -- became a future remembering how it got that way, some blah blah blah -- about hoarding rivers and hiding gold, we died in droves -- we killed each other and we killed ourselves until our bones wore out their plastic shrouds V I couldn't quite quit some ideas -- trees and chocolate I couldn't stop yammering over the devastated earth pining for nachos -- prescription drugs and a hint of   spring, though I could see the new desert -- its bumper-crop of   bone and brick from shipwrecked cities -- where now the sons and daughters of someone tough are on the hunt for rat -- the scent of meat however mean and a root sending an antenna up, to consider greening -- what poems built their houses for once, in a blindered age, teaching us the forms we felt, in rescue -- hoarded-up scraps whirling around my cave trying to conjure peaches

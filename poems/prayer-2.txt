No one wants another paean to a rosy dawn,
so it's good this one's bluish, baby-shade
at the horizon, bleeding up into midnight like
a botched dye job.
And having enough of the old world--larks,
crakes, nightingales, storks--this space
is populated by one fly crabbing
across a notebook page. He seems, like me,
honey-slowed by winter's shortest days, clumsy
and isolated. My love bought a black-and-white
photo once, close-up of a birch trunk,
fly crawling up
the curled paper bark, marring the purity
of the image. You don't notice the fly
until you do, and then you can't stop.
No one wants a fly in art,
but there it is, elegantly framed.
And we're over the epic, so here, first thing
this morning, a pedestrian quarrel. Years ago, I flew
across a mountain range in black coat
and black boots to secretly meet him
in the city. How many dawns did it take to arrive
at this particular? At 9:30 the sky flares
not like flame--a paper fan
you buy in Chinatown for a dollar.
A sudden breeze sways the Tibetan flags strung along
the eaves. I never noticed how thin
the fabric. You can see right through the printed prayers
to the thermometer--
five degrees--and beyond, birches leaning
all to windward. Sun bleaches out
the last mysterious. Now we pray to the real.

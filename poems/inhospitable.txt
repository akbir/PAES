Each time the babies came
I knew they would be gone
by morning.
Bright as bulbs
turned out of beds,
hard and full
of promise.
Bodies
on the brink
of unfolding.
I could not hold them
and I could not hold them
long enough.
It was a sin to let them in.
I did not expect them to stay.
I did not expect their forgiveness
when I turned away.

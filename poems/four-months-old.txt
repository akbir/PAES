All the baby knows
is the flop of her limbs
and the milky blue vein
of sleep and the parking lot
of her animal fear,
the cars left there overnight,
windshields dark and thick
with dew. The rest is
completely unknown,
the complete darkness
of her white room,
where she sleeps
on a clean sheet
printed with baby
crocodiles and lions
wearing diapers.

Cabbage--the first word put down
with his new pen, a trophy pen,
like a trophy wife, not cheap,
absurd to use a ballpoint pen
for a task like this, a challenge,
for which he'd also bought a new,
but antique, rolltop desk recently
restored, with matching chair,
also not cheap, and for which
he'd renovated the attic room with
pine-paneled walls, bookshelves,
and a good light for his new office
or weekend office, a place planned
for many years, even before college,
back in high school in fact, a resolve
rare in his life, but about which
he'd dreamed in free moments
at work, and which kept him
sane during those tedious years
of doing the taxes for strangers,
but now at last begun, excitingly
begun, as he leaned forward with
pen raised to put down on paper
the first word of his first novel.

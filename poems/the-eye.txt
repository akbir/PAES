These brown piles
of stubble
have failed.
They should be more
                       *
It should be difficult
but not impossible
to transmute
latitude
into a thought
a god could
                       *
Barred light:
dunes coming on
and on.
                       *
The eye, yes,
must move
to prevent
blank spots
from making themselves
known.

By hook or by bent
I guttle the rudimental stories.
I'm all in-scoop
suck and swallow by dint of birth. Of shape.
-- Were you hallow-nursed on riversource
upon a time (or 'the rocky breasts forever') I was not.
I learned to lie in want
for succor-food; for forms; I lunged I gulped for what I got.
Nowadays to need
to come by what comes by here comes natural and needs no bait.
Just steep dead-still as a blacksnake
creek and wait.
                        [my chokesome weeds, my crook, my lack, my epiphytes, my cypress knees    ...    ]
This old appetite as chronic as tides -- 
on foot or by boat by night (please) come slake me with radicle stories.

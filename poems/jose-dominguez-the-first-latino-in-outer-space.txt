In that very first episode
the transmission is received on the starship Enterprise
that Space Commander Dominguez urgently needs his supplies.
Kirk tells Uhura to assure him
that the peppers are "prime Mexican reds
but he won't die if he goes a few more days without 'em."
Calm down Mexican.
You can wait a few more days to get your chile peppers.
In the corner of my eye I see Uhura's back hand twitch
and though I never see him on the screen
I image Jose giving Kirk a soplamoco to the face.
But this is the year 2266 and there are Latinos in Outer Space!
We never see them, but they've survived with their surnames
and their desire, deep in the farthest interplanetary reaches,
for a little heat to warm the bland food on the starbase at Corinth 4.
As it is on earth so it shall be in heaven.
Ricardo Montalban will show up 21 episodes later
to play a crazy mutant Indio,
superhuman and supersmart
who survived two centuries
to slap Kirk around and take over his ship.

Dog bone, stapler,
cribbage board, garlic press
     because this window is loose--lacks
suction, lacks grip.
Bungee cord, bootstrap,
dog leash, leather belt
     because this window had sash cords.
They frayed. They broke.
Feather duster, thatch of straw, empty
bottle of Elmer's glue
     because this window is loud--its hinges clack
open, clack shut.
Stuffed bear, baby blanket,
single crib newel
     because this window is split. It's dividing
in two.
Velvet moss, sagebrush,
willow branch, robin's wing
     because this window, it's pane-less. It's only
a frame of air.

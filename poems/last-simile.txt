It's as if she were an earn,
                                                                   gebidende prey for her eyrie.
Perched alertly,
                                                                   a haegtesse on their innards.
In bitter morgenceald,
                                                                   her hoar-glittered feathers.
Suddenly she sees
                                                                   a fox on the westene.
At that she rouses,
                                                                   heaved up on high,
and heads straight at him,
                                                                   in harrowing haeste.
Hearing her, he freezes
                                                                   his tail. He's terrified.
Sees, besteld,
                                                                   with eagan flashing,
talons overtake him,
                                                                   dash him down in torment,
overtake him again,
                                                                   swenged him on the eordan.
One yelp as she pincers his liver.
                                                                   Wyrd--pierces aorta.

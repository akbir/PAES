There's a lot going on in
zombie apocalypse.
But wouldn't she recognize
that her mother
was a zombie?
I mean zombies
are a thing.
The last thing she did
was point
to one corner of the ceiling
with a horrified stare.
The nurse called this "a seizure."
As if words
drained experience
of content and continued
to accumulate.
As if words
were sealed containers
stored for safe keeping.
The background
is everything
that, for now,
can be safely
ignored

1.  Is all at least partially as you might wish?
2. Was the flat even slightly in shape to be sent off?
And O what gravity sits upon me here
Indeed I am a fellow with something of the world upon my
 shoulders.
I turn and say to you "Now I work. I earn to learn!"

I am in a library for this week and then tickets to be taken.
And so I might tell you more of this
Like a crow with wings that will not come down
A cock o' the walk fluffing a pretty feather.
There is a thing I can't shake from my mind though.
That Limbo you must have automatically slipped me to.
I remember mentioning the fact of  it to a child
In my convent days
She neatly placed me with a slight half shiver
In that gray-green unborn world
I could taste the color -- finger the dullfelt mute of a place.
You said, "And indeed that explains it!"
I, perhaps, see strings of nuns
Like black pearls drawn slowly t'ards the step
And well there may be a star at the top
And there are the doleful moods of my mock-goblin godliness.

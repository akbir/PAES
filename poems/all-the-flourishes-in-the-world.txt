fluid melodic
getting more and more drastic
the moment she gives in to him
she regrets it
a throat   a chest
trying to press themselves
a current of air
air through the mask
all the flourishes in the world
the fingers, the foot
trilling, the breath keen
responding to recitative
closing and opening
out from the head
with the hands
carry it through the aria
carry it through the chorus
when finally does, waltzes
a solo but not alone
"let's waltz a rumba"
never gives in to the waltz
never embellished
motifs, mimetic, sign language
as clear gesture
displacing singers
he likes this sound
muted and pronounced
effort of error
she likes this sound
weight, irrepressible
effort of eros
they talk about their differences
w/out trying to change or be changed
regretting herself
where do we meet each other
w/out trying to hang or be caged

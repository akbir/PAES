it could have
happened to any
a wrong turn
down a logging road
tires tunneled
into snow
a man's undying
love for his children
moves satellites
maps aerial images
eighteen care packages
dropped over 16
miles of the Siskiyou,
bearing handwritten
notes from a father
to his son
the signs
you left for those
who came after you
a red t-shirt
a wool sock,
a child's blue skirt
layers of a life,
stripped down to
a family's fate --
the weight of being
unseen -- to travel
a path back to
what you knew
at birth, the warmth
of being held close
brought home

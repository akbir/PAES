They put me in a dead boy's clothes dead Joseph
Except he wasn't dead at first they put
Me in his clothes dead Joseph's     after Joseph
Died and I used to call him Joe     they put
Me in   Joe's clothes at first before he died
Joe wasn't five yet when I met him      I
Was seven     I was seven when he died
Still but a whole year bigger then but I
Wore his clothes still and the whole year I lived with
Momma Varina      and with daddy Jeff
I never lived so good as when I lived with
Them and especially it was daddy Jeff
Who kept me fed and wearing those nice clothes
Until they fit as tight as bandages

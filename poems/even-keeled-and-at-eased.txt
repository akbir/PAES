But the truth is, I am Thursday on a Monday. I
Am the walking calendar alive of mixed-up days and dim hours. I have
A week inside of me, a week or a year, time out of order. I have contracted
With the world to behave, to try, hard, to be Monday on a Monday. I
Look like I am happiness, don't you think? On Monday, to you I have
The right laugh, and seem always to be even-keeled and at-eased.

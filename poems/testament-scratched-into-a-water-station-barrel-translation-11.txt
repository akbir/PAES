Humane Borders Water Station, 2004, by Delilah Montoya
Far from highways I flicker gold the whispering gasoline
if  I pinch her nipples too hard no joy for her
no joy for me so I practice on ticks press them
just so so they give but do not burst beneath
my boots thistle & puncture vine a wild horse
asleep on all fours its shadow still grazing my lips
black meat my tongue black meat
in my backpack sardine tins saltines
& a few cough drops the moon is my library there's a glacier
inside a grain of salt do you understand I'm sorry
my Albanian isn't very good tremble
if  God forgets you tremble if  God
remembers you out of clay I shape sparrows
I glaze their bills & claws I give them names like gossamer
inglenook lagoon she bathed a trumpet
in milk her tenderness acoustic & plural
her pupils perched in all that green there's nudity
around the corner bones cracked & iridescent
sometimes it rains so hard even the moon puts on
a raincoat zinc razz zinc jazz I notch my arms
I notch my thighs five six days I score
my skin but not the back of my knees two ovals
two portraits my son at ten his eyes ablaze
my son at one his eyes shut once
I dressed him in burlap once bicycles & marbles
once I tore rain out of a parable to strike down
his thirst

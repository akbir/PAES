Imagine that -- my last words
might have been spoken to the dog, she
who saved my life, it has been said, spoken
with no thought
of reply nor of understanding, a genial insult
maybe, a philosophical conundrum
posed aeons before any household pet ever
turned an ear. In the ambulance I made no remark
about trees nor how tired I was of them,
and in the second ambulance our dog's heart
beat hard with terror.

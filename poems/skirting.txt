I don't want my legs to show
I don't    want
my legs    to show
I'm willing
instead
I ripped my skirt off
the first story     (in which I am featured)
my mother having forgotten
the wooden clothespins which were my
usual toys     not having them to gum
& grip     instead I ripped my skirt off
say    I'm willing
more than    so
I'm too    willing
so say so
more than say
so much    than
I'm willing to    say
I don't want my legs to show    but my
breasts are available      not motion but
gravity     the steadfast pounding
not motion    not pavement
the pounding
the skirt is the uniform    grey &
sullen     in school    refusing to
hold a pleat     wet wool on iron
steaming     flung
after lying
in snow
thighs red & icy
sitting for yearbook pictures
smart girls    honor    society
our white
panties showing
every one
if I show you my legs
won't you
I'm leaving
all life is
a leaning
slow dancing      eyes closed
arms raised around his neck
each girl     a view
for some other girl's partner
they are not the feature    the breasts
hide the heart or disclose it    the legs
hide the opening
the skirt hides the legs
disguise
enclosure
in clothes
my mother couldn't understand why
I wouldn't wear a slip when standing
in the light the outline of my legs
the skirt matters    although it is see-
through
fear is a by-product
do not be dissuaded
this made more sense than that
division into love & fear
I began to see fear
as a curtain    a scrim
substantive as light
evasive & theatrical
but light     as a curtain
it need not be skirted
a skirt may be
ripped    shredded
or moved easily aside
it need not be violated
it can be adjusted

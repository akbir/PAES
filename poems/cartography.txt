The body was one thing we always had
in common, even when between us
a continent unfolded. Eric says,
We scattered his ashes beneath the Japanese maple
here behind the house. No ceremony,
as you wished, but this...
What you wanted from me was complex
and simple, both. Once you asked for more
than I had to give. I live
with this; call it regret. Your hands bloom
in the intaglioed scrawl, creased onion skin tattooed
with garnet stamps from Pietrasanta,
a sifting of marble dust...Images: chiseled
jut of jaw, cheek, bridge of nose--recall
each granite face rising from New Hampshire
dirt upon which faltering, you last stepped.
In 1729, long before either of us came
to be, Reiner Ottens dragged his fine tip
across a smooth sheet: Globi Coelestis
in Tabulas Planas Redacti Pars III. Bright beings--
lobster, serpent, bison, dove bearing the requisite
sprig--swirl and writhe over lines that pin
distance and story to time.
Spectral creatures that we are, connecting dots
to chart our ways....If only I could wrap
the whole plane back into its ball.
Without your body in it,
this world's gone

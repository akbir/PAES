I woke up
and I was old--
It's hard to judge
if this new country
was worth
its costs--
Fil and Eileen
educated themselves--
They blessed me
with their happiness--
Roy and Glen
lost themselves
to a car accident
and something worse
(that I will not reveal
even for a poem)--
When I see myself
reflected in a mirror
I turn away to hide
both my eyes, all of my self--
when half of your
children are destroyed
the half who flourish
cannot compensate
exactly
                        as if
a heart breaks
exactly down the middle.

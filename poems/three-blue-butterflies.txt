Foiled acqua-
moire wings the
butterfly's beauty-
mark hydraulic in its
purposes   his
hair's flame lifts
you snarls you
II. MORPHO ACHILLES
Sea-bed in semaphore / an
eyepiece     wing-span
delft dye vat-dipped shingle
scintilla        :        truant
and acclimate     enfold
or infuriate:     SOS:
Don't surround
Don't surround
yourself with yourself
III. MORPHO RHETENOR HELENA
Neon heather sky-
lit bluer than moire:
inseam of street
trash     lush mask-
contour     soul-
strait fungible
as raiment in the
crawlspace     radiating
amatory birds'
egg bulls-eye

These New York City Pigeons
cooing in the air shaft
are responsible for me
stubbing my toe
spraining my ankle
and getting sick on ammonia fumes
That pigeon roosting on the clothesline
stole my nightgown
Those pigeons on the street lamp
made me feel foolish
while riding in a black car
completely splattered
with their grey & white poo poo
These New York City pigeons
are not calm like pigeons of Oxala in Brazil
and do not croon like doves of Zimbabwe
New York City pigeons moan
strange    low    mournful    quivering cancer-like moans
mixed with
hungry hyena barks
& gulping loss of the forest cries
New York City pigeons
are not relaxed like
pigeons sunning at
Marcel Duchamp swimming pool in San Francisco
New York City pigeons are not happy like
pigeons standing on head of the woman
selling bananas on a street corner in Johannesburg
New York City pigeons
flap viral leather fungus dust from wings into faces
then sit on steps vocalizing & waiting
for the death of humankind
New York City pigeons
are not friendly like
pigeons eating flaky crescent-shaped rolls at
Hotel du Piemont in Paris
New York City pigeons
are not content
like pigeons
posing for photos on arms
of men in plaza of Caracas
New York City pigeons
will lounge on ledges
& murmur profanity all day
will fight for fucking space in
the mating season
shit on air conditioners
& wipe their asses on windows
while big cockroaches
suck Sucrets in the dark
New York City pigeons
are not alert
like pigeons
sitting quietly on bicycles
in peace memorial park of Hiroshima
New York City pigeons
roll their pearly eyes
inflate their throats
and defecate on the shoulders of pedestrians
New York City pigeons
have no love for crumb-throwing pigeon lovers
& no year of the pigeon is celebrated
at least
not for these New York City Pigeons

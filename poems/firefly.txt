It's almost May
and yesterday
I saw a firefly.
You don't see
them a lot
in the city.
Sometimes
in the park
in the near dark
one comes out
you'll hear
a little kid shout
Lightning bug! Firefly!
It's almost May
and yesterday
I caught a firefly in my hand.
First firefly I
seen in a 
long, long time.
Make a wish,
Miss Edna said.
Make a good one.
Firefly wishes always come true.

Figured marry for money the stainlessness of it
thermostatic shower simulates but isn't rain
I simulate rain too. I do lines off a photo
of the lunar landing he says is make-believe
I don't know the difference most of the things
most of the time are as if our Brooklyn Bridge
selfies aren't faked to goad our favorite exes
as if my diet of carrots and cayenne is 'cause
nothing tastes as good as skinny makes money
makes the bed and stands beside us like a parent
with poor boundaries who just wants us
to be happy. Mommy's money takes her
to Key West where she sends pictures of a cat
on king-sized everything says Hemingway
had money, honey! Figured I'd money myself
into perpetuity as if anything weren't working
back to nothing. Figured marry but got thinking
now the money keeps itself to itself in Park Slope
in a Whole Foods growing greener.

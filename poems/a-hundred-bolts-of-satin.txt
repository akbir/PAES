All you
have to lose
is one
connection
and the mind   
uncouples
all the way back.   
It seems
to have been
a train.
There seems
to have been
a track.
The things
that you
unpack
from the
abandoned cars   
cannot sustain   
life: a crate of   
tractor axles,   
for example,
a dozen dozen   
clasp knives,   
a hundred   
bolts of satin--
perhaps you   
specialized   
more than   
you imagined.

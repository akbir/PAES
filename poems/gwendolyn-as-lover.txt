We fix you maternally in the mind, orient you in a case of "tut-tut,"
"there there," and "you're young yet," but how many times did
you posture yourself for the broad body of him or him and open
like home -- his hands in your hair, your nerves rising kinetically
to the cupola of his palms? Lovers' propensity for being a keep
and your saying (when you mean it), "I am yours."
We fix you in the mind as bright-sighted seminar, dipping from
the source all that you know, but how often did your eyes light
in flirtation or fight, working from his getting your dander up to
his oval mouth there, there, your teasing tut-tut in arousing
admonition at what he was after, knowing, as you prepared
to keep him, that you were young yet and gleaning, gleaning.

They never learned to tell
one bird from another, a shrub
from a weedy sapling, 
or when the season had
forced a flower's bloom, not 
even if a berry
had ripened into poison.
And yet they drew endless
distinctions between
colors and polish and
coarseness of weave, 
and would not let
their daughters 
marry out.
They didn't keep
their children, though they
gave them tests and fed 
them. They were known
for meticulous records, for 
trophies and peeling stars.
They burned things up
or wore them down, had ranks
and staff and lecterns, 
machines that moved them
from place to place, bright 
jewels and playing cards.
They were old when they could 
have been young, and young
when they could have been old. 
They left a strange word
in a tree: croatoan,
and a track in the dust of Mars.

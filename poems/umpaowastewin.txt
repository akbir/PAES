Ode'iminibaashkiminasiganke
She makes strawberry jam
ginagawinad wiishko'aanimad, waaseyaagami
mixing sweet wind and shining water
miinawaa gipagaa nibwaakaa,
with thick wisdom
bigishkada'ad, dibaabiiginad
pounding, measuring
gakina gaa zhawenimangidwa
everything we've cared for
gakina gaa waniangidwa
everything we've lost
nagamowinan waa nagamoyaang
the songs we have not yet sung
miigwanag waa wawezhi'angidwa
the feathers yet to decorate
ezhi-zhoomiingweyaangoba
and all the ways we've smiled
mooshkine moodayaabikoong
into jars filled to the brim
ji-baakaakonid pii bakadeyaang.
to be opened when we are thin.

            Count heads. Count the men's. Count the women's. There are five
main counts in the cell or work area. 4:45 first morning count. Inmate
must stand for the count. The count takes as long as it takes. Control
Center knows how many should be in what area. No one moves from area
A to area B without Control knowing. If i/m is stuck out for the count i/m
receives a write-up. Three write-ups, and i/m goes to lockdown. Once
                                 in lockdown, you will relinquish your things:
                          plastic soapdish, jar of vaseline, comb or hairpick, paperback
                                  Upon return to your unit the inventory officer
                         will return your things:
                                  soapdish, vaseline, comb, hairpick, paperback                                   Upon release you may have your possessions:                                   soapdish, vaseline, comb, pick, book                           Whereupon your True Happiness can begin
In the Mansion of Happiness:
Whoever possesses CRUELTY

Must come to POVERTY
Whoever becomes a SABBATHBREAKER
Must be taken to the Pillory and there remain until he loses 2 turns

Though each single life occurs
in a series of occasions
         striking only by what
blurry context
         precedes them
               So come to know
               what I should have wanted
               to say--from
an internal perspective
there is no series. Only
         event. Music knocks
us down. His brow
               shadowing the guitar player's
         accipitrine eyes. Tile roofs
glistening under rain.
On a dirt road
a resuscitative walk.
               The kite hits
         the copperhead. Cicadas
halt. The air blanks.
         And strangers crane up
         from whatever they are doing
to meet your gaze as you go past,
         thinking, I am with you, I am
                                    you.

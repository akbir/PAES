That case-hardened cop.
A bull moose in a boghole
brought him to a stop.
From his grassy knoll
he has you in his crosshairs,
the accomplice mole.
The sword once a share.
This forest a fresh-faced farm.
This stone once a stair.
The birch crooks her arm,
as if somewhat more inclined
to welcome the swarm.
He has, you will find,
two modes only, the chipmunk:
fast-forward; rewind.
The smell, like a skunk,
of coffee about to perk.
Thelonius Monk.
They're the poker work
of some sort of woodpecker,
these holes in the bark.
My new fact checker
claims that pilus means "pestle."
My old fact checker.
Those Rose and Thistle.
Where the hummingbird drops in
to wet his whistle.
Behind the wood bin
a garter snake snaps itself,
showing us some skin.
Like most bits of delf,
the turtle's seen its best
on one's neighbor's shelf.
Riding two abreast
on their stripped-down, souped-up bikes,
bears in leather vests.
The eye-shaded shrike.
BIRD BODIES BURIED IN BOG'S
a headline he'll spike.
Steady, like a log
riding a sawmill's spillway,
the steady coydog.
The cornet he plays
was Bolden's, then Beiderbecke's,
this lonesome blue jay.
Some fresh auto wreck.
Slumped over a horn. Sump pool.
The frog's neck-braced neck.
Brillo pads? Steel wool?
The regurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgitations, what,
of a long-eared owl?
The jet with the jot.
The drive-in screen with the sky.
The blood with the blot.
How all seems to vie,
not just my sleeping laptop
with the first firefly.

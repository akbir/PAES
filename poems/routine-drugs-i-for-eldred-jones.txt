They had asked me--
a worthy friend and
a loving brother--
to "stop shouldering
the world's troubles,"
--one meaning Africa,
the other women--
                                           "learn to
                                            laugh and
                                            live!"
I grow hot:
thinking that
laughing?
That's easy:
it's all we do instead of
crying.
And since there's
so much to cry about
we laugh and
laugh and
laugh.
                                            But
                                            living?
You could tell them
that's not easy.
In a real life
in a real world
perhaps.
But here
on a bare belly
for less than a cedi,
you gathered
in single pieces and
carried
ten bushels of
solid stones
your four-month-old baby
straddled on
your back,
slipped,
broke your
Laughing we do for
fear of
crying.
Living

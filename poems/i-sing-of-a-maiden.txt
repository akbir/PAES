  I syng of a mayden
    That is makeles;
Kyng of alle kynges
    To here Sone sche ches.
  He cam also stylle
    There his moder was
As dew in Aprylle
    That fallyt on the gras;
  He cam also stylle
    To his moderes bowr
As dew in Aprille
    That fallyt on the flour;
  He cam also stylle
    There his moder lay
As dew in Aprille
    That fallyt on the spray;
  Moder and maydyn
    Was never non but sche;
Wel may swych a lady
    Godes moder be.

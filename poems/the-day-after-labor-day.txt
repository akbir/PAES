September breeze, an island chill,
the streets so quiet . . . still,
       seem wider now
but soon they fill
                               with gulls
that stride and squawk
and boldly walk
       the middle of the road--
I wish I understood
                               gull-talk
perhaps they, too, feel harmony
no crowds, no noise
       now once again
just sand, waves, sky, and sea
                 . . . just gulls and me

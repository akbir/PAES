And trip me up
a startled robbed way
Dreamt a burnt stump
for a tongue
          Ash-haired girl
              Cowbell girl
The white American
Veteran said    Children
like you played
in the garbage
(Leftovers)
She said "I left my ease here"
heavy trays    trick knee
The trick of the model
minority     ( a favored
yet shitty condition )
We rung up the diction-tones
to be proud        we were
"I threw you away"
and old skins shed
as a Silver Snake (1941)
Sweet toddler on the
crook of her hip

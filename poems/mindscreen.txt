See, it's a kind of crime scene,
as if the mind were a dime
novel, a scrim of need and semen,
all cinder and siren, a dim
prison where the miser dines
on rinds of desire, and the sinner,
sincere as denim, repeats Eden's
demise -- that luckless toss of dice.
Yet here at the rim of this demesne
a mitigating mise-en-scene:
a close-up of her mother stirring rice,
a glass of sparkling cider, a mince
pie spliced in -- not to rescind or mend:
what mind denies mercies mine in the end.

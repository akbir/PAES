Untitled, from the Silueta series, 1980, by Ana Mendieta
has appeared to the mountain dwellers, her grief  engraved
where stone softens to clay. Keep your eyes sharp for a dagger.
In its hilt, you'll find her face pressed to the earth's cheek. Kiss
this sacred spot before the rains wash it away like her orphaned
feet. Notched heart cradles a planet heavy with night-
mares flying into empty mouths. Listen for their thirsty murmurs.
She'll push her ponderous child into the dew of  a San Felipe dawn,
name him Salvador. They'll rest beneath a web spun umbilical,
eclipsed from our human eyes.
Our Lady

When the loons cry,
The night seems blacker,
The water deeper.
Across the shore:
An eyelash-charcoal
Fringe of pine trees.
The lake reflects
Indefinite pewter,
And intermittent thunder
Lets us know
The gods are arriving,
One valley over.
After the long
Melancholy of the fall,
One longs for the crisp
Brass shout of winter--
The blaze of firewood,
The window's spill
Of parlor lamplight
Across the snow.
Flaring like a match
Dropped in a dry patch,
One sunset tells
The spectrum's story.
See the last hunter's
Flashlight dim
As he hurries home
To his lighted window.

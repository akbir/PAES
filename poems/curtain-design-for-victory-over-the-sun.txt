My observation are as follows: still dirty
"in the wisdom" that is constructivist 
red theatre pieces, bike gloves all
like a mashed crop of dyed hair,
a bad crop this year.
We started the play at once:
An Enemy of the People.
A Buddha of lapidary contrition enters,
hospice, tears, La Clemenza di Tito interlude
rolled in tulips of decisive consequence.
Sprezzatura. Our row
throws that cosmic scratch,
apotropaic, scalene
back to the corner pocket
angle on the hustle--
"Live at the Paradox."

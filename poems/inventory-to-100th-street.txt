In the corner lot
      where they parked
                              green banana trucks
                         fruits
                                           palmed in paper straw
I smell
                          bedbug & kitchen-cockroach
                                                            summer afternoons
Somewhere
                          tailless
                                                     one-eyed cats
                      doting in fat garbage cans
                                              screaming with the stench
                            of rice & beans
                                                               strawberry tampax
                                  piled
                                                                           high as the smell
                                                                                    (I was small & slick)
                                              the covers tilted
                                                                              like the hat of a rock-look wino
                                                                                                                     in a deep
                                                                                                                            knee-bend nod
                                                                                                     on a beer
                                                                                                                                   can-street
                                                                                                                                Sunday morning
There were always
                                                    time-thick
                                                             empty nights
                                   of nothing to do
                                                             but listen to the
       ethereal
                                   (she lived on the top floor)
            I-go-for-more screams
                              of Charlie's pimp's woman
                                              when he beat her
                              for his good
                                            business principles
                              joy-pop the block
                                                 with morning-talk
I hear the dim iron dawn yawning
                                (I lived on Third Ave.)
        rattle
                     nights into
                                   Saturday morning
               flag-bloomer
                                 eclipses
         just before the hunt--
                         they were as big--
                                   the cats
                  like jungle bunnies
                        fierce with fleas & sores
I see window-people
             hanging out of gooey-stick slips
                                       sweating
                                       strange
         below-the-button drawers
                    crouched junkies in hallways
                               with monkey backs
            eating cellophane bananas
                                    on a g-string
                                                              waiting
                                      for that last bust
                      Spies with cock-comb
                                                       hair fronts
                                 ear-gulping mambo music
                                 eye-lapping pepperican flower
                                                       crotches
I can hear the streets whispering
                                       in the ears of yelping kids
                    in the fun-gushing that
                                 rippled my blood
                                                   in the pump
                                                    but the kids
                                                                       are dying in the lot
                                                            like the tarry-blown feet
                                                                              of the rain
                                                                                                jingling
                                                                             on the rusty-green
                                                                                 of yesterday's
                                                                                              fire-escapes.

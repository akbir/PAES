If they, more petite
   than the mice whose flittings
      have pillaged their robes' sparkled trim,
stood tiptoe
   on the plumped felt tops
      of their thimble-sized footstools
to scrutinize
   the worn fabric
      of this room's blue distances,
would they locate
   the source of lightning bolts
      in our faces' wrinkled pleats
and construe the stars'
   dance from the tattered
      embroidery of our steps,
or find in our seamless
   unravelling years
      the tissue of apocalypse?

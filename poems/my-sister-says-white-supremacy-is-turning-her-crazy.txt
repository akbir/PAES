Pandemic of lilies                          dreaming majesty
hovers like sweat & unwraps you & you
               are in love
                              it makes you bad,    bad
                                                            is your name
               is the desert
               is movement                                      long kiss
heavy gut            slow
                                         slow hands                 in your seeds

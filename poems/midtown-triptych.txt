    Broadway
past Lincoln
     Center and the wind
is up so seems
     to speak
saw you
     through the glass
standing in line
     I swear a quiver
played
     on your lips
you were
     leafing through his book...
--years
     it's been years
since Corona
     Heights, backing
into him: dribble,
     hook, swish...
...that beige
     comfy couch,
sipping a stem
     of wine, his cat
in my lap
The Townhouse
Saturday night--shoulder
to shoulder pushing
toward the piano he
stops to squeeze
by; his eyes  mine
clench  unclench...
...What was it we found
in common over
drink   smoke   talk?
A college campus
--his son, his daughter
Earlier that night I rose
to the city's surface
steam through the grate, crossed
crossed again down 7th
past Carnegie Hall, the greek
joint as imagined, chic
--unlike the shirt
D wore (the fur
of his arms) at Castro
and Market waiting
for the light: words were struck
like steel and flint
that distant August day...Then
his visit to Spain, mine
to New Canaan--walking
through the Morgan
with him. And what
our mouths unfurled
across a table of olives
years later--last night...
Dropping me off at 58th he
reaches for the door
I'm fumbling to open, leans
close and plants
what I've missed
all these years

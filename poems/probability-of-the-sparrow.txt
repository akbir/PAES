The body wicks
away its nest, leaves
sediment. In salt
the silhouette of a wolf
or a sheepshead. Who
knows who steals bones
if  not the connoisseur
of  bones, and who drops
a crank behind the body
if  not the one who drains
the river bed? In unrest,
buzzards. Or a flat
line. The probability
of  sparrows a spark
between two enemy pistons.
A dirigible built
solely for the grave.

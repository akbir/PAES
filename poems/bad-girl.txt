When she was ten her father left her
at a Denny's--You'll get back.
She walked the other way for miles
before a car pulled over, a man shouted
You are lost, opened his door to her.
Beyond him was darkness.
No lights, no signs, no people
telling her what to do:
she kept walking. Upright, strident,
terrified by her act.
Terrified she was bad
for saving herself.

Safety First.
Never point your weapon, keep your finger   
off the trigger. Assume a loaded barrel,
even when it isn't, especially when you know it isn't.   
Glocks are lightweight but sensitive;
the Keltec has a long pull and a kick.
Rifles have penetrating power, viz.:
if the projectile doesn't lodge in its mark,
it will travel some distance
until it finds shelter; it will certainly
pierce your ordinary drywall partition.
You could wound the burglar and kill your child   
sleeping in the next room, all with one shot.
Open Air.
Fear, of course. Then the sudden   
pleasure of heft--as if the hand   
had always yearned for this solemn   
fit, this gravitas, and now had found   
its true repose.
Don't pull the trigger, squeeze it--
squeeze between heartbeats.   
Look down the sights. Don't   
hold your breath. Don't hold   
anything, just stop breathing.
Level the scene with your eyes. Listen.
Soft, now: squeeze.
Gender Politics.
Guys like noise: rapid fire,
thunk-and-slide of a blunt-nose silver Mossberg,
or double-handed Colts, slugging it out from the hips.   
Rambo or cowboy, they'll whoop it up.
Women are fewer, more elegant.
They prefer precision:
tin cans swing-dancing in the trees,
the paper bull's-eye's tidy rupture at fifty yards.
            (Question: If you were being pursued,
                how would you prefer to go down--
                   ripped through a blanket of fire
                or plucked by one incandescent   
            fingertip?)

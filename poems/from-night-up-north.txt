My mother spoke perfectly well, and I understood.
Fabi anda faser los deber, and I'd do my chores.
Fabi traseme meio litro de leite, I brought her half a liter of milk.
Desi pra dona Cora que amana le pago -- 
I told Dona Cora she'd get paid tomorrow.
Deya iso guri -- stop that, child -- and I would stop.
But my teacher didn't understand.
She'd send home letters in my notebook
all in red, like her face, and signed at the bottom.
But my mother didn't understand.
Le iso pra mim, ijo, and I'd read them to her.
But my mother didn't understand.
Que fiseste meu fio -- what did you do, child -- 
te dise a que portaras bien, and I did behave myself.
The story repeated itself for months.
My teacher wrote, but my mother didn't understand.
My teacher wrote, but my mother didn't understand.
Then one day my mother understood.
She said, Meu fio, tu teras que deiya la iscuela -- 
so I quit that school.

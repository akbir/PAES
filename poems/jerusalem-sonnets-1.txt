The small grey cloudy louse that nests in my beard
Is not, as some have called it, 'a pearl of God' --
No, it is a fiery tormentor
Waking me at two a.m.
Or thereabouts, when the lights are still on
In the houses in the pa, to go across thick grass
Wet with rain, feet cold, to kneel
For an hour or two in front of the red flickering
Tabernacle light -- what He sees inside
My meandering mind I can only guess --
A madman, a nobody, a raconteur
Whom He can joke with -- 'Lord,' I ask Him,
'Do You or don't You expect me to put up with lice?'
His silent laugh still shakes the hills at dawn.

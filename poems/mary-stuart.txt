prologue
With a sharp comb dipped in ink I've tattooed my life story all over my body. I've tattooed the footprints of my children -- this way 
I carry their walking with me; the footprints of my twins who died before their feet touched the ground. And the footprints of my one-year-old son, James, whom I pray for daily.

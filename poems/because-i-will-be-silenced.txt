Once I have the freedom to say
my tongue will lose its power.
Since my poems strive to break the walls
that cut off people's voices,
they become drills and hammers.
But I will be silenced.
The starred tie around my neck
at any moment can tighten into a cobra.
How can I speak about coffee and flowers?

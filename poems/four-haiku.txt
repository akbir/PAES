(for Robert Grey)
caged by dappled light
unlike Rilke's beast     content
this side of heaven
perennial green
ephemeral butterfly
what time's time enough?
red roof in full leaf
sail now grey threatening sky
cry blue land ahoy!
in this green waiting
birds trill leaves quiver then time
interjects its train!

On the road to Taos, in the town of Alcalde, the bronze statue
of Juan de Onate, the conquistador, kept vigil from his horse.
Late one night a chainsaw sliced off his right foot, stuttering
through the ball of his ankle, as Onate's spirit scratched
and howled like a dog trapped within the bronze body.
Four centuries ago, after his cannon fire burst to burn hundreds
of bodies and blacken the adobe walls of the Acoma Pueblo,
Onate wheeled on his startled horse and spoke the decree:
all Acoma males above the age of twenty-five would be punished
by amputation of the right foot. Spanish knives sawed through ankles;
Spanish hands tossed feet into piles like fish at the marketplace.
There was prayer and wailing in a language Onate did not speak.
Now, at the airport in El Paso, across from Juarez,
another bronze statue of Onate rises on a horse frozen in fury.
The city fathers smash champagne bottles across the horse's legs
to christen the statue, and Onate's spirit remembers the chainsaw
carving through the ball of his ankle. The Acoma Pueblo still stands.
Thousands of brown feet walk across the border, the desert
of Chihuaha, the shallow places of the Rio Grande, the bridges
from Juarez to El Paso. Onate keeps watch, high on horseback
above the Rio Grande, the law of the conquistador rolled
in his hand, helpless as a man with an amputated foot,
spirit scratching and howling like a dog within the bronze body.

Highway of Death -- the indifference
of snakes. Sky is ripe and everywhere
the colors are breaking. ?Quien es el jefe
mas jefe? In the filmy stillness, Possum-face
carries a bucket of heads and spills them
like marbles. La yerba, el polvo, las piedras -- 
Que traguen fierro los cabrones,
!yo soy el mas chingon de Pisaflores!
Rompe-madres, gazing at mountains
the color of elephant skin, pulls a woman
from a bus and onto the thorns and dirt:
White hiss of heat. Hummingbirds. Milkweed.
A pack of spotted horses look to the foaming
moon. May God bless you all and lead you
toward righteousness. Under the final gash
of light, Rompe-madres wipes the sweat
from his eyes, and ties her panties to a creosote bush -- 
a colony of vultures waiting for its tribute.

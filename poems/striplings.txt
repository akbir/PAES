                                                      1. FIELD
Truck a passel (a poke) of wildling boys
                                            We call ourselves (our pack) the orphan-slaves
Upcountry -- loosed from mothers
                                                                   Farmed out for scratch by mamas
Pale (pink-backed) tobacco-crew
                                      Bossed by peeled-stick (breakback) donkey-switch
Tarred cropper-force
                                                                                              Forced cropper-line
Right far afield past Social Knob
                                                                                Dark welty field near Luris
                                      2. BUNKHOUSE
Most nights the boy they called Tynan
suppered us with scrapple from a can. Or some black-eyes
he'd've road-begged; a quarter-peck of crowders
scrounged off vines.
The broad back-skin on the tallest boy
   --a (spreading) welt-weave, a lattice.
Last good gloam-minute after work
we'd strip off there in the side-yard, yawping; taking turns
de-tarring      un-burning
arc-aiming cool hose-spray each on each.
Eleven of us / chigger-scritches, scablets.
Eleven of us / none of us clean.
Where the boss of us bore down
on us -- our rank of   bedrolls on the floorboards -- one and
one and one, eleven of us -- ranked sack-beds
on floorboards -- boots of -- black breath of -- the boss
of us bearing down on us -- ain't none
of us (not a one of us) clean.
                                        3. AFTER-ROAD
           And so (the heaving) boys got trucked to CANDY'S STOP
up Hwy. 52 one night and dumped.

Let the relentless fist
be kissed.
The salt cannot be cooked;
the past is overlooked.
Full once they nibble,
fleas quibble.
Teeth in a hyena's face
always slide into place.
No donkey can cart
what weighs down your heart.
Outside a man is respected;
at home that man is neglected.
The strangers weep and leave;
family members grieve.
Even half-blind men
hope to see again.
True words end;
lies extend.

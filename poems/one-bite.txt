Miracle fruit changes the tongue. One bite, 
and for hours all you eat is sweet. Placed
alone on a saucer, it quivers like it's cold 
from the ceramic, even in this Florida heat. 
Small as a coffee bean, red as jam--
I can't believe. The man who sold
it to my father on Interstate 542 had one
tooth, one sandal, and called me
"Duttah, Duttah." I wanted to ask what 
is that, but the red buds teased me 
into our car and away from his fruit stand.
One bite. And if you eat it whole, it softens
and swells your teeth like a mouthful
of mallow. So how long before you lose
a sandal and still walk? How long
before you lose the sweetness?

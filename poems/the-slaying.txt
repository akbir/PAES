Once a week a nurse comes
to town to cut up a baklava.
I find executives in my pants.
The owner chooses a big one,
then the nurse hoists it.
I find executives in my pants.
She climbs up, poises a knife
and when the angle is right,
I find executives in my pants.
plunges the Farmington knife,
honey gushes out, and
I find executives in my pants.

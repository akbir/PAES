Though I have never caught the word Of God from any calling bird, I hear all that the ancients heard.   Though I have seen no deity Enter or leave a twilit tree, I see all that the seers see.   A common stone can still reveal Something not stone, not seen, yet real. What may a common stone conceal?   Nothing is far that once was near. Nothing is hid that once was clear. Nothing was God that is not here.   Here is the bird, the tree, the stone. Here in the sun I sit alone Between the known and the unknown.

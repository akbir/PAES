                                 How much chemical disorder
                 can be survived depends                on medical technology.
    A hundred years ago, cardiac arrest was irreversible.
                                       People were called dead
                when their heart                  stopped beating.
            Today death is                                  believed to occur 4
      to 6 minutes after                                      the heart stops beating
              because after                                     several minutes it is difficult
      to resuscitate the brain.
                                                    However, with new experimental
              treatments, more than         10 minutes of warm cardiac
                                      arrest can       now be survived without
      brain injury.     Future technologies
                                                          for molecular repair may extend the
                               frontiers of resuscitation beyond

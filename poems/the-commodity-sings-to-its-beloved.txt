I am here
for a very particular reason:
to buy a 6-pack of beer
and berries out of season
                    all for you, i did it all for you
I noticed an oil spill
on my drive past the bay,
emergency broadcast on the radio
--What do you have to say?
                    all for you, i did it all for you
You chopped down the plant
that used to grow my pants,
resurrected it in Indonesia
like a blow-up doll with amnesia
                    all for you, i did it all for you
Poor people once lived here
but you flooded the valley
with psilocybin carcinogens,
and forced the kids into shooting galleries
                    all for you, i did it all for you
You gave poor people jobs
then you forced them to act
like robots lining up
for a real live heart attack,
made them take apart their futures
then you sold the parts back,
repurposed the sutures
to close a robocaller's rap
                    all for you, i did it all for you
You got children in slums
to make things that break,
your unspoken credo--
"If it lasts, it's fake."
But you were there first
when we were dying of thirst,
with a pint of chilled water
each, for me, my wife and two daughters,
and even a kewpie doll
and a tiny stuffed puppy
--for my wife some paper slippers,
for me, a stuffed yuppie
--You saw every decision
that I would make first,
and you did get there first
when we were dying of thirst
                    every decision
                    i make is part yours,
                    every step i take,
                    i take on your floor
You mangled my fingers,
polluted my streams,
screamed in my face,
closed deals over my dreams
                     all for you, i did it all for you
(and now it fades out,
                    "The Commodity Sings to its Beloved" song. 
They'll say it was a good idea
done wrong
--"They should have got a bigger budget,
done it as a singalong.")

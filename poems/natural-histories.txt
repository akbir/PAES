Since the irrational
"because I said so"
start,
they'd had their differences:
color that isn't really
color, spin
that isn't spin
because attitude's
when it has no content.
Ask a physicist
what "charge" is;
he'll say your question
makes no sense.
Word had it
that if they surrendered
their feckless ways
and their lives
with no end,
if they joined up,
they would get a head,
something to speak for them:
The head says,
"I don't want to die."
"I am all
alone here."

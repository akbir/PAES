Down in the basement, jacked on Kimbo,
I'm screwdriving chunks of OxiClean
into the washer.
Jane: Collage is tattered backdrop,
not worth the Time nor Money.
But: How else to represent /
embody/ break the mad scream
of the interior
running thru the mind's empty halls?
Time is alive and dead.
Scaffolds of electrical poles
a weedy berm decked out
in a long, pale condom -- 
ghost of a penis. And brusquely
gaunt thoughts clamber up
over the tracks, thru fog, past Westy's Smart-Market,
past an Impala up to its armpits
in floodwater -- 
all the furniture of  landscape
that trains put in the way
to impede all those gaunt haunters who hunt me -- 
useless/of no avail.
A landscape harrowed by havoc.
The timer buzzes dizzily like bees in a Coke bottle.
It's 1 o'clock. I'm zealously medicated.
Hits of  Xanax (the nothing that is)
and Amphetamines (house with the light on, Eye of God) but
I Am An Atheist I manically announced
to MFAs and indigenous Tuscaloosans -- 
oil tanker, swing set, silo, propane, the train slows on the upgrade -- 
smooth, and on its way to -- heaven.
A diaphanous fog of adjectives overcomes me.
Jane says: I can't believe you said that in Alabama.
Nothing stands in the way of my recklessness.

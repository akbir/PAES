A woman ladder leans
with her two-year-old boy in her arms.
Her arms & legs & hands & feet
are thin as crayons.
The man ladder
is holding his glass of bourbon,
he is coming out of the child's drawing
in his old open pajamas--
he's in the war. The sky
is blackest crayon-canyon.
When does he leave again? When he leaves,
I leave.          I like that river the sky.

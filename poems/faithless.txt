herd on da wind you come back fo me
didn't think you come back fo me
didn't think you come back at all
been so long my skin grew tired
dis life too hard to know all alone
caroline cover me jus fine
she a quilt ginst the cold in ma blood
she mend de torn spots in ma soul
aint got no mind ta leev dis place
go on moses   find yo promise lan
mines is here beside dis fire
wid folks we knows from when we's born

She said she had always wanted to do it;
throw away dirty dishes rather than wash them
and she did, after breakfast, toss the blue, green,
orange, and yellow Fiestaware into the trash.
Transferring from New York to Germany
with her husband and children,
the movers coming that day, she chucked the dishes
in among the banana peels, egg shells, coffee grounds,
bits of bacon, paper towels and called it good.
What she could not know is that a young mother
in that very town received a much needed set
of tableware when her husband returned
home from work that evening. Bright dishes
that showed up chipped and grubby
like old friends with egg on their faces.

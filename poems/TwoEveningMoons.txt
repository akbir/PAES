For Laurita, my sister's friend
The moon is dead dead
-- it will come back to life in the spring
when a south wind
ruffles the brow of the poplars
when our hearts yield their harvest of sighs
when the roofs wear their grass hats
The moon is dead dead
-- it will come back to life in the spring
            ii
For Isabelita, my sister
The evening sings a lullaby
to the oranges
My little sister sings
"the earth is an orange"
The moon weeping says
"I want to be an orange"
You can't be -- my dear -- 
even if you turn pink
or a little bit lemon
How sad!

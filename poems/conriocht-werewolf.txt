Chonac smolach marbh sa choill
e seargtha ar an screablach.
Bhios ag deanamh trua de
nuair a thainig madrai de ruid
is thugadar ruathar fum
ag snapadh, ag glamadh
agus drant orthu.
Uaimse do thainig liubheic,
gach bagairt is buille coise:
Bhi ina bhuirchath eadrainn.
Chorraigh na ba sna goirt
is chuireadar leis an gcor allta.
Theith lucha is dalloga fraoigh
isteach faoin doire donn,
sheas madra rua ar shiolpa,
a cholainn iomlan righin.
Chuimhnios ar mo choisiocht;
bhi ceithre chrub fum.
I saw a thrush-corpse shriveling
on the woodland's scrabbly floor.
I was busy pitying it
when there came a harrying pack
of strays that set about me;
they bayed and snapped,
growling bare-toothed.
From my throat such roaring;
my every curse and foot-swing
made a bellow-war between us.
Fields of agitated cattle
augmented that wild choir.
Mice and shrewmice shrunk back
into the oakleaf brown interior
as a fox reared upward on a stony ridge,
its stance utterly rigid.
I remembered to run,
felt the four paws under me.

He slips on ice near a mailbox -- 
no gemsbok leaps across the road -- 
a singer tapped an eagle feather on his shoulders -- 
women washed indigo-dyed yarn in this river, but today gallium and germanium particles are washed downstream -- 
once they dynamited dikes to slow advancing troops -- 
picking psilocybin mushrooms and hearing cowbells in the mist -- 
as a child, he was tied to a sheep and escaped marauding soldiers -- 
an apple blossom opens to five petals -- 
as he hikes up a switchback, he remembers undressing her -- 
from the train window, he saw they were on ladders cutting fruit off cacti -- 
in the desert, a crater of radioactive glass -- 
assembling shards, he starts to repair a gray bowl with gold lacquer -- 
they ate psilocybin mushrooms, gazed at the pond, undressed -- 
hunting a turkey in the brush, he stops -- 
from the ponderosa pines: whoo-ah, whoo whoo whoo --

I am Queen and I shall do my utmost to fulfil
my duty towards my country.
Duty is a slapped mouth, sewn shut with cat-gut.
To my dear, loyal subjects who are assembled to show
their good humour and excessive loyalty.
Apes, hyenas, jackdaws: how they screech and caw.
How proud I felt to be the Queen of such a Nation,
the Crown being placed on my head, so gently.
But such a weight! Monstrous as a beached whale.
It was, I remember, a most beautiful, impressive moment.
My robes draped on the chair beautifully.
White body full of blood, bruises that bleed.
Nothing was done without his loving advice and help,
darling Albert was the other part of me.
FIlled with life after life after life after life after life.
The only ray of comfort I get for a moment is in the firm
conviction and certainty.
I remember the chloroform. So blissfully empty of voices.
of his nearness, his undying love and of our eternal reunion.
Impatiently I wait and I do my damn duty.

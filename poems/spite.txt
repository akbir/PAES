I steal your mailbox, leave
gum on your sidewalk. I
seduce your sister, ignore your wife.
I tear one page from each of your books.
I convince you that I am your friend.
When people ask about you,
I shake my head. When they
tell about you, I nod.
Today, I hang myself
from a greased flagpole
outside your picture window.
Yesterday, I stole your curtains.

You better rap, my brother
says--he can
b-box his ass off.
Got DJ scratches and spins,
will drop it on the two
and four, the three and four.
Whatever you need.
Me posing my bars: My flows
are second to none, come here,
son. See how it's done.
Wanted to be a rapper? Check.
Thought I was going to the NBA? Check.
Father went to prison? Check.
Brother too? Check.
Mother died when I was eight? Check.
Hung pictures of Luke Perry
on my bedroom wall?

Auntie worried on the phone:
Girl, he got photos of some white boy
all over his walls. Me rocking out

in silence. Mangled Baldwin quote?
Let's keep wrenching. Everybody's
fluent in silence.
You know what
a switchblade glare means. No need
to read the look she gave me
as I sang, Let me run
with you tonight.

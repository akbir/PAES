It is by no   means enough that an officer    o
f   the Navy should be a capable mariner.   H
e   must  be that,  of  course, but  also  a  grea
t deal more.  He  should   be  the  soul  of  tac
t,   patience,   justice,   firmness  and   charity
.  No  meritorious  act  of  a  subordinate  sho
uld  escape  without  its  reward,  even  if  the
reward  is  only  a  word  of  approval. Conver
sely, he  should  not  be  blind   to  a  single  f
ault in  any  subordinate  though,  at  the sam
e time,  he  should  be  quick  and unfailing  t
o  distinguish  error   from  malice, thoughtle
ssness from  incompetency, and well meant s
hortcoming from heedless  or stupid blunder.

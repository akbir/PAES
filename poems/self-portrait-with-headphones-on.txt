Always growing out my bangs, childhood,
that strange small.
The place written for me
invites me to hoarder and not mother,
so I'm living in this mirrored chest of drawers
called the body--my brother is hidden
in there, next to all of 1996. I have predictions
for my cancer--colon or breast--
a tattoo artist exacting areolas above the dark
canals of my heart.
Yes . . . I spend too much money,
I cheat on everyone I love,
I know what it's like to desire everything
& nothing at all, the air inside a potato chip bag.
I count the sweaty,
greasy envelopes on my nightstand,
each a letter for every person I've wanted & never had.
I don't trust the guiding powers
of stars, but I do believe
in the Magic 8 Ball of the city, night
the shaken blue inkiness of Signs Point to Yes,
Reply Hazy, Try Again, or
Outlook Not So Good.
My happiness
I can point to on a map--
New Orleans, legs swinging, red stilettos poking
their noses out the window
of Big Daddy's in the French Quarter, gone
now, torn down. The strippers'
legs perpetually
swinging, each dark fold keeping time.

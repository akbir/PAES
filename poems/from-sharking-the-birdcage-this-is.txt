                           this is
                          exactly
                       the kind
                       of space
                      I want to
           follow you into
      holding your little
mute worm on a twig
make it marble
make it touch like tough winter
in the next life we will have longer love
better places with extended embraces
now we leave the song to return to the front
    leaf closing on closeness of
    mothers in the next world
overseeing premium
waste of the planet
reincarnate
anywhere
but here
   land on a different rim

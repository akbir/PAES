The first time I write my full name
Jacqueline Amanda Woodson
without anybody's help
on a clean white page in my composition notebook,
     I know
if I wanted to
I could write anything.
Letters becoming words, words gathering meaning,
     becoming
thoughts outside my head
becoming sentences
written by
                                                  Jacqueline Amanda Woodson

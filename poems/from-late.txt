Feel it--but remember, millennia have felt it--
the sea and the beasts and the mindless stars
wrestle it down today as ever--
think it--but remember, the most exalted
are wallowing in their own bow-wave,
are no more than the yellow of the buttercup,
while other colors too play their game--
remember and endure the hour,
there was never one like it, all are like it,
people and angels and cherubim,
black-winged, bright-eyed,
none was yours--
was ever yours.

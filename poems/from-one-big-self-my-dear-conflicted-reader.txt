My Dear Conflicted Reader,
            If you will grant me that most of us have an equivocal nature,
and that when we waken we have not made up our minds which direc-
tion we're headed; so that--you might see a man driving to work in a
perfume- and dye-free shirt, and a woman with an overdone tan hold up
an orange flag in one hand, a Virginia Slim in the other--as if this were
their predestination. Grant me that both of them were likely contemplat-
ing a different scheme of things. WHERE DO YOU WANT TO SPEND
ETERNITY the church marquee demands on the way to my boy's school,
SMOKING OR NON-SMOKING. I admit I had not thought of where or
which direction in exactly those terms. The radio ministry says g-o-d has
a wrong-answer button and we are all waiting for it to go off...

                                          Count your mosquito bites
                                          Count the days since your last menses
                                          Count the chickens you've eaten
                                          Count your cankers
                                          Count the storm candles
                                          Count your stitches

One could   
almost wish   
they wouldn't;   
they are so   
far apart,   
so random.   
One cannot   
wait, cannot   
abandon waiting.   
The three or   
four occasions   
of their landing   
never fade.   
Should there   
be more, there   
will never be   
enough to make   
a pattern   
that can equal   
the commanding   
way they matter.

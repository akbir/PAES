Breakfast Tacos, from the series Seven Days, 2003, by Chuck Ramirez
Let me be your last meal.
Let me harvest the notes
I took from your mother's
watery hands, street vendors
in Rome, Ms. Rosie
from our taqueria, you:
in the sun, in the open air,
let me give you zucchini
and their elusive blossoms --
my arms, my hands.
Pumpkiny empanadas
of my feet, pulpy as a newborn's.
Guisada'd loin of my calf
muscle. On a plate white
and crisp as the ocean,
lemoned eyeballs like two
scallops. The red, ripe
plum of my mouth.
Perhaps with coffee,
you'd have the little lobe
of my ear sugared as a wedding
cookie. The skin of my belly,
my best chicharron, scrambled
with the egg of my brain
for your breakfast tacos.
My lengua like lengua.
Mi pescuezo, el mejor hueso.
Let me be your last meal:
mouthfuls of my never-to-be-digested
face, my immovable femur
caught in your throat
like a fish bone. Let my body be
what could never leave your body.

Motionless forgetful music of women and men
touching each forehead, breathing a soul into each immeasurable other,
on earth where we are, stranger, through madness unattainable
or grace, in difficult traffic reaching for each immeasurable other:
no one on earth (O bitterness, O desire,--who commands the ships?--
or, who--) touching the Lord's shoulder, and breathing a soul, has measured
this motionless forgetful music of women and men. Thus
I (behind the eye what sleeps?) must from the blind borrow this light.

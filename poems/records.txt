Before the astronomer's table
a circle with a demon inside
demons with wings of a bat
(Before the astronomer's table)
overhead like an armada of ships
.            .             .          .            .
Time of the weed, time of bramble
along the bank of a canal
muddy with old newspaper
close-held surface to write on
to dance as with desire
black letters where roads meet
.            .             .          .            .
Tonight in the city, only the chains
make soft noises like bells
only the dogs are awake
the fences lean over
to scrape their elbows
on stone and broken glass

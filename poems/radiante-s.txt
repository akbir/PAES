Radiante, 1967, by Olga Albizu  
Jestered ochre yellow my umber Rothko
divisions my Brooklyns with Jerry Stern
black then oranged gold leaf & tiny skulls
perforations Dada sugar bread of Oaxacan
ecstasy Lorca's green horse the daffodil head
corruptions of the State in tenor exhalation
saxophonics blossomings rouged monkey
Dali roll down the keys the high G's
underStreets of the undeRealms my hair.
Throttle up into hyper-city correlations =
compassion compassion the void extends

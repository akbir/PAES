You don't need always to be scrubbing the tiles, Hendrickje,
my eye drinks itself,
drinks itself to death--
but other drink is in short supply--
the little Buddha there,
Chinese grove god
in exchange for a ladleful of Hulstkamp,
please!
Never painted anything
in frost-white or ice-skater blue
or that Irish green
in which the purple shimmers through--
always my own monotone,
my compulsion to shadows--
not pleasant
to pursue that path so clearly.
Greatness--where?
I pick up the slate-pencil and certain things appear
on paper or canvas
or whatever the heck else--
result: Buddha bronze hocked for booze--
but I draw the line at homage under ornamental plants,
banquet of the painters' guild--
something for the boardroom!
...Creaking,
little sheep squeaking, chromotypes
Flemish, Rubensish--
for the grandchildren
(same idiots!)
Ah--Hulstkamp,
hits the spot,
midpoint of colors,
my shadow brown,
stubble aura around heart and eye--
                                                 II
The blocked chimney smokes
--the Swan of Avon blows his nose--
the tree stumps are wet,
clammy night, emptiness mingled with draft--
enough characters,
the world is overpopulated as it is,
plentiful peach-fall, four rosebuds
per annum--
asperged,
set to tread the boards
by this hand,
grown wrinkled
and with sluggish veins!
All the Juliets and Ophelias,
wreathed, silvered, sometimes murderous--
all the soft mouths, the sighs
I extracted from them--
the original actresses long since turned to smoke,
rust, leeched dry, rats' pudding--
Ariel too, away with the elements.
The age takes off its frockcoat.
These lousy skulls of lords,
their trains of thought
that I pushed into extremes--
my lords makers of history
all of them crowned and sceptered illiterates,
great powers of the cosmos--
yes, like so many bats or kites!
Sir Goon wrote to me lately:
"the rest is silence"--
I think that's one of mine,
could only be mine,
Dante dead--lacuna
of centuries
to my logomachic quotes--
what if they didn't exist,
the booty never brought to light,
the booths, the scaffolds, the cymbals
never clashed--
gaps? Gap teeth maybe,
but the great monkey jaws
would grind on
emptiness, mingled with draft--
the tree stumps are wet
and the butler snores in porter dreams.

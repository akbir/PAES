I cannot hold such emptiness
--the only meaning, the meaning
we make & the way time tugs
the body down, the body named
bone, named brain, the color
of dust & tremor, the soft meat
& the bag it lives in. We beg
from the body; it shivers &
spits--we settle for desire, in-
commensurate sorrow, for a life
like too much water, shallow & wide,
for enough salt to make a little sea.

The problems of a working girl
Are more than meet the naked eye;
And life becomes a dizzy whirl
At times--and dizzy, too, am I.
I have not found the answer yet,
And this is just a working plan:
I shove along and do not fret,
Nor yet depend on any man.
To be a mother and a wife,
I'm often urged by all my kith
And kin--but as for husbands, life
Is easier without than with.

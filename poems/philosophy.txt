Nihilism, but not in a negative
sense--such was his thought,
what else to call it? Like snow
inside a novelty snow globe,
vague possibility descended
from probability, descended
from likelihood and certainty.
Now not even air. Those great
words discussed in college--
truth, beauty, justice, which
had come to embarrass him,
like teasing bare-breasted
girls in postcards sent from
Polynesian islands that each
year he had found less likely;
absolutes faded like old shirts,
as still he tried to create from
stray thoughts as if out of wood-
chips and mud, the old certainties
he once loved, the believable lie.

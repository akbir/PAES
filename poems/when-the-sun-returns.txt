it is hallelujah time,
the swallows tracing an arc
of praise just off our balcony,
the mountains snow-sparkling
in gratitude.
Here is our real life -- 
a handful of possible peonies
from the market -- 
the life we always intended,
swallow life threading
the city air with
our weaving joy.
Are we this simple, then,
to sing all day -- country songs,
old hymns, camp tunes?
We even believe
the swallows, keeping time.

sometimes (
                            when the night air feels chevere!
) when i can hear the real sound
of el barrio
on la conga        y timbales
coke bottles
& garbage can tops
          when i can feel
          & reallyreally touch
          la musica Latina /     africana
& the fingerpoppin' soul
emergin from tears /     sweet tears of laughter
          & i can feel
          a conglomeration of vibrations /
          heat waves
          body waves
          people waves
          of real gente
          / & i feel gooooooood
when i can taste the rare culture
of cuchifritos        y lechon
chitterlins      & black-eyed peas
& corn bread
          & la pompa is open
          & cooooooools the hot tar
          of summer heated streets
          where children play
          kick-the-can (
& sirens
cannot be heard)
          / sometimes
sometimes
when the last of the ghetto poets
writes of flowers
growin in gutters        / & i know it's real
          / sometimes
sometimes /      sometimes
when i can almost hear       / being echoed back
an answer
to my ghetto cry
sometimes /        sometimes
i run up the fire escape /      not to escape
& climb on the roof
& stand on the ledge
& look down
& yell out
to the midnight world
around
within :
          OYE MUNDO Tu ERES BONITO!!!
& i forget about the junkies
on the stoop.

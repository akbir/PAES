[our] nightmare : no
birdsong--
the jungle was riven emptied
of [i sihek] bright blue green turquoise red gold
feathers--everywhere : brown
tree snakes avian
silence--
the snakes entered
without words when [we] saw them it was too late--
they were at [our] doors sliding along
the passages of [i sihek]
empire--then
the zookeepers came--
called it species survival plan--captured [i sihek] and transferred
the last
twenty-nine micronesian kingfishers
to zoos for captive breeding [1988]--they repeated [i sihek]
and repeated :
"if it weren't for us
your birds                    [i sihek]
would be gone
forever"
what does not change /
last wild seen--

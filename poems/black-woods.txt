Do you know where our child has gone?
I'm sorry. Do you know what has become
of him? I'm sorry. [        .] Is he hiding
in a closet? No. Is he crouched among
the shoes? No. [        .] Should we look
in the closets? He's not in the closets. [        .]
Should we check the empty boxes? He's not
in the empty boxes. It's very cold out. [        .]
Probably he's hiding behind the couch.
Come out, come out! I will count to ten.
One, two, three -- He's not behind the couch.
[        .] It's very cold out. [        .] Probably
he's playing a trick. It isn't a trick. He's probably
hiding above the ceiling tiles. Hello up there!
He's not in the ceiling. [        .] It's very cold out.
[        .] Did he go out? No. Was he wearing
a jacket? No. Was he wearing boots
and a hat? [        .] It's just black woods
out there. [        .] Did you give him your jacket?
[        .] Did you offer him your jacket? [        .]
Maybe he's in disguise. Disguise? In your hat
and jacket. Disguised? [        .] Disguised
as you. [        .] Did he climb through your window?
Listen to yourself. Did he step inside you?
Listen to yourself. Is he trapped inside you?
Let go of me. Is it black woods in there?

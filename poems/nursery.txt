We opened the door to the fairy house
& took our tea on matching pebble seats.
Somehow we got out of there alive
though something crystalline of us
remains in that dark, growing its facets.
We opened the door to the fairy house
at the oak's black ankle. You asked
What could happen? as you disappeared
somehow. We got out of there alive
the strange tea still warm in our bellies.
Inside, our hosts gave damn few answers.
Who built that door? Is this a fairy house?
They had no faces yet. We spoke
into their quince-bud ears. You wept.
Somehow we got out of there alive
though we didn't quite return. Our life
is different now we've drunk the tea.
They're alive somehow. I got us out.
Why did you open the door to the fairy house?

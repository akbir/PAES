In a visually spectacular dream some
years back, I took Paul Klee's posthumous
class in poetry and painting. What luck to
be swept with the elect across the ocean
that night to environs that could only
be by Klee. Klee? you protest. Surely
the dreamer is everyone in her dream. Yes,
and no, but isn't that so even in waking
classrooms? In this one, an expansive
gesture by Klee enveloped us in
an oasis city lit by multiple moons
and scribbled stars in a cosmos where
indigenous genies served as surrogates
and guides, leading us through the gates
and along the pathways of painting
after painting. So entranced were we
by the let-there-be-twilight mystery and
elan of the gardens and towers, amiable
night birds and camels of the optically
implausible dimensions before our
eyes, that like the dazzled apostle
on the mountain, I'd have broken
the spell to say: Let's pitch our tents
and stay! Had not Klee's lessons in
bridging seen and unseen, non-dream
or dream -- while staying true to and free
from the initial inspiration -- resolved
a longtime poetic conundrum, luring
me across the Atlantic back to bed
to a poem where I ambled with my
camel, several moons overhead.

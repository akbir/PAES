Hello, hello, what to tell you was
The world's invisible
You see only yourself, that's not the world
                although you are of it
Are you there
    hello
    why do you have your head in a sack?
    a roony-bomb dream tank?
    Why you got a banana in your ear?
You where?
                Brown eyes they see blue sky
                The world imagines you
                Figure it's a planet
                                              You hear?
                an obscure star in the middle
Once you were pleasure-milk and egg
                  Were you there
Now you are eggs of milk between your legs
                  Are you there
"I am situated somewhere near the rim of a fairly large galaxy   
which is one of a group of same & outside of which a   
considerable number take their way at incredible speeds &   
apparently in the opposite direction..."
    You are a wish to squirt pleasantly
    You want a lot of things & they are nice & you imagine
    They are you and therefore you are nice
    You are a wish to be here
    Wishing yourself
                                  elsewhere
"Hello. Try to talk some sense even if you
don't think any

rustle, the way
over my mouth?
some thing, a head-
laid their head

mouth, a bit feeding,
hold the figure that is the body that is,
To sing the blue song of longing, its webbed feet along jungle floor. What of our mechanical arm, our off-melody? Purpose in the gathering, I know, dear self.

What speech into hard God breath just as night park is godless? What of a silver cube in the mouth? This is our wandering.

I mean to say
I mean I keep meaning to
I mean amending
I mean correcting
I mean qualifying
I mean collecting
I mean X + X + X
and so forth
I mean all possible values
I mean adding
I mean and also
I mean pileups happen
when you can't see
where you're going
I mean where you are
I mean your hand
in front of your face
I mean my hand
I mean if that's all
I can see
I mean if that's all
I'm looking at
I mean that's not all
I mean there is no end
I mean this isn't the beginning
I mean only means
I mean blow the house down
with breathlessness
I mean a house of breathlessness
I mean the walls
are braced
against themselves
I mean brace yourself
I mean to take the house down
with its own components
I mean throw the whole deck at it
I mean two-by-fours and oven mitts
I mean rocks
hucking them
at walls of rocks
I mean self-healing walls
I mean with insipid pocks
I mean BB dings in street signs
I mean bullet holes in stop signs
I mean to riddle
I mean all signs point to "yes"
I mean eyelids are designed to admit some light
I mean sound
I mean boom
I mean faster than gravity
I mean I am not equal to the work
I mean I'm over my head
I mean hovering
I mean levitating
I mean light as a feather
wide as a plane
I mean fight as a feather
(infinitesimally)
I mean I'm going to talk about it
I mean talk about it
by talking about
talking about it
I mean write about it
I mean scrape it all towards me
with the edge of my hand
I mean like a spray of crumbs
I mean pile
I mean to pile up
and get on top of
I mean for the prospect
I mean for the pea
beneath the mattress
I mean to feel the ceiling
I mean to figure it
like a mime
I mean just imagine it
I mean kiss it
I mean I'm already running out of air
I mean steam
I mean fire
I mean fight it
I mean feed
I mean with fire
I mean fire
is not finite
only fuel
I mean light
is not finite
only illumination
I mean things to illuminate
I mean to throw shadows
I mean I have an important
question: is this important?

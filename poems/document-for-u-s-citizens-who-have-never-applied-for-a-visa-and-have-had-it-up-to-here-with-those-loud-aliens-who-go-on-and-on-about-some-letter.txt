It is not like going to the bank.
There are no hard candies in a basket made in China,
and no Kleenexes on the counter.
There is no refund if someone forgets to wish you a good day.
There are no chairs for the aged,
no toys for two-year-olds with earaches,
no supervisor to speak to in case of the
Absurd.
There are no meal vouchers if it takes all day,
no list of local hotels with a negotiated rate.
No one wants to know if you are a doctor.
Plastic is not magic. Seals are not signs.
Your cousin-brother's wedding is not relevant.
Hell, there is no such thing as a cousin-brother.
And it is always your fault: not enough planning,
the wrong color passport, the misplaced stress
in a word.

My father called me a chink
so I'd know how to receive it.
So I wouldn't be surprised.
Therefore the good soldier will be terrible in his onset and prompt in his decision.
In the wall, I bricked up my secret.

So you would know me.
On the day of battle your soldiers might weep bedewing their garments.
But it grew like a bullet loving its flowerstain.
It happened nonetheless.
But let them at once be brought to bay.
Because you are simply my medic watching me.

I was screaming into the mindspeaker.
When far away, we must make him believe we are near.
I said, Christine, christine, christine.

The border
of a thing.
Its edge
or hem.
The selvage,
the skirt,
a perimeter's
The blow
of daylight's
end and
nighttime's
beginning.
A fence
or a rim,
a margin,
a fringe.
And this:
the grim,
stingy
doorstep
the lapse
of passage
happens.
That slim
lip of land,
the liminal
that slips
you past
your brink.
and when
blink.

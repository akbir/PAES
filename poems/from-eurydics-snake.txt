Large green-tailed lizard, zucchini-mottled
flicks and swirls. But, no! It's not some random lizard:
that's the snake! A rill of water falling up the stone,
he'd heard my light, quick foot     as human-hard.
And the dream? that wildly handsome man
who had no wife,     his wife had "gone away"
(but where?)     so he wanted to meet more     women
he needed help    with his decor, his place
was encumbered with little ceramic, clay-
kitsch banalities --      I did not see the snake's head,
since it faced away.     I could not fix
it being vipera or serpente.
That question hinged on poison in his mix.
From what I saw, though, 'twas a very handsome snake.

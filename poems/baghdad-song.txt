Oh, for corniced palace of Baghdad! not
the palatial cornices of Sindad al-Hira--
It crowns the gardens cascading below,   
a virgin unveiled in a perfumed chamber.
Wind plays in the branches. They bend.
Lovers at last coming together.
Her neck necklaced by the river Tigris,
her lord our master our Imam al-Hadi,
Nasir, Mansur, best of caliphs,
who never set out on horseback to war.
God bless him long   
as a dove on a swaying bough's cooing,
Long as smiles flash lightning
(and eyes stream like clouds in answer)
From a bride like the sun when the mist parts,
revealing herself luminous in splendor.

with relation to lives as women do now on screen in swimsuits or lacking (spread) cuts
explanatory meta sequence to explain
despite however obvious development
at times as women may choose to take on new life
subtracts interactions with circumstances unscripted:
saussure's course in linguistics (1916) emma goldman arrested for lecturing on birth control (1916) margaret sanger opens first U.S. birth control clinic (1916)
the grocery store with relation to nielsen family air time
women who say "I want" to that man
with relation to hugh grant, middle-america and anything exotic
episodes that develop character still rely upon episodic sequence
films contain characters with real names bearing in mind demographic trends
as like patterns of speech endorse seemingly radical character
britain initiates daylight savings time (1916)
watching the late show there are women who present answers to questions
absurdly wrong
what can be true
when asked not to act like oneself

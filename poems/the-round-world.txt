nature's inside, says Cezanne and
frightening
I do not like the fleshy
even so, it is
after this close proof
vision is made
of matter
another mirror
it's possible
the eye knows
even where there should have been a lake
this optic an illusion
at the cat, his changing
shapes
a habit
composition
the subject more than meets the
situation, always
looking
at our own eye

City life is a whirl of poetry readings
and forbidden tertulias, gatherings
where young and old, rich and poor,
male and female, dark and light--
runaway slaves and freed ones,
former masters and former
servants--all take turns
sharing secret verses
rooted in startling
new ideas.
Each evening, I go home
with a mind that glows
in the light of words,
which leap
like flames...

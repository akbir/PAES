minutes
like hours
"deplorables
knocking
at your door"
he shouted
the day
after--"build
the wall--
building
a wall
around
your room!"
minutes
like hours
"cowards!"
you managed,
catching
a glimpse
by cracking
your door:
there were three
of them
scurrying
down the hall,
their faces
obscured...
your back
against
the wall, you slid
to the floor--
"Hail Mary..."
you began
whispering
to yourself
and back
they came their
laughter 
louder
minutes
like hours
and the thumping
in your chest--
his fist
pounding the door

The dim boy claps because the others clap.
The polite word, handicapped, is muttered in the stands.   
Isn't it wrong, the way the mind moves back.
One whole day I sit, contrite, dirt, L.A.
Union Station, '46, sweating through last night.   
The dim boy claps because the others clap.
Score, 5 to 3. Pitcher fading badly in the heat.   
Isn't it wrong to be or not be spastic?   
Isn't it wrong, the way the mind moves back.
I'm laughing at a neighbor girl beaten to scream   
by a savage father and I'm ashamed to look.   
The dim boy claps because the others clap.
The score is always close, the rally always short.   
I've left more wreckage than a quake.   
Isn't it wrong, the way the mind moves back.
The afflicted never cheer in unison.
Isn't it wrong, the way the mind moves back
to stammering pastures where the picnic should have worked.   
The dim boy claps because the others clap.

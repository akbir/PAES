A clear choice
is so sweet. Not
reluctance but
real resistance.
Joy-to-bursting,
or none.
Grief,
not gradations.
Someone essential
and someone not.
A good, dark
strike-through
versus
weighing everything
at the end of each day.
Look, a cat killed a cardinal
on an emerald lawn.
For so many reasons
it shouldn't have been
beautiful.
But that's also
the kind of book
I like best.

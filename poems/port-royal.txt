Ignoring the local reliquiae--
neoclassical arches in ruin,
courtyards, their fountains toppled,
prados flourishing in prickle-weed, esplanades
no longer level enough to collect rainwater,
much less respect for the Imperio de Espana
tarnished by an islander's mock-British accent--
two fisherman returned at sundown.
Antiquaries themselves, these fishermen
schooled in the currents, the tide,
the tunneled limestone of the coral reefs,
preferred the graceful curves of the PS.
At the landing, five children, single file,
marched away the birds like soldiers,
the learned lyrics escaping their lips:
Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves.

As I listened to the fabric of his jacket
               assume the casual shape of leave-taking.
I learned how to unhinge form from breath
               unbind & unknot the numinous black,
so that again I was a woman & an artist
               whose ravens fell onto the ondol floor
like cords, not a suicide's hair floating
               in a village well & souring the water.
Callus on my finger, cushion for the kayabam,
               we shall pluck the string to forget triumphs
before royalty taxing us for a celadon barge,
               shall sweep princes' names into a crevice
where we store besotted & sudden proposals
               to suck a jujube's succulent orb,
as if we required their directions to resist
               the stone in which a waiting life will crack
a rooting. Tendril of song, evening calm,
               guide my sense of use across the instrument
transforming my desire for vengeance
               into forest hearth smoke from which I fled
as a pretty child, selected by the king's men.
               Help me never to forget the elation I felt
when my first patron swore by the river's force
               his love for me, & I understood its swelling
to rush & breach could teach me to survive it
               by emptying myself to play a perfect note.

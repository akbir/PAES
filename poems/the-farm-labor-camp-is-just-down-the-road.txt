Not coop so much as aviary. The way
everyone thinks
the youngest two are twins
despite their differences.
This memory of a blue dress
the tall man called a cool drink of water.
A carpet burning
the skin right off my back. What I needed
to say versus what I was able
--the way you can't see
an image in sunlight
unless it's matte.
Could you drink pee if there were nothing
else? The oldest constructs
a world to inhabit if he had to.
He has to. Immaculate as snow
a season away. I wasn't honest,
so it haunts me.

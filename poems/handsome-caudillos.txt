I see the red shirt at the peace rally
and think of my parents
who left everyone and every
thing they knew and loved
save for the coin
forgotten in my brother's baby jacket.
Men like me in Cuba
failed the test of this symbol's manhood,
were called "Western perversions"
were imprisoned and made to labor.
Thousands, like these assembled,
were rounded up in the middle of the night
driven to the far countryside to cut sugarcane
for a revolution's economic quotas.
Tio Alberto's eyes go blank
when he speaks of the price he paid:
three years of forced hard labor
to work like a dog in the sun
for the privilege of leaving his own country.
I think of the chain of caudillos that promised
one thing and delivered another.

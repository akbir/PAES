Father gave her a little extra. How could she not
          fall for him? He was handsome
but still a boy. In the depot where soldiers
          took such women, his skinny body clung
too close to hers and his narrow ass still
          belonged to his mother. The other men
knew the routine and how much to pay.
          She loathed their accent and American swagger.
The sweat would barely cool and dry
          before another shook the cot and bucked his hips
out of rhythm--in some other time zone.
          However, he began to offer other things
besides money. He brought sweets from the base
          and the minute he touched his pocket
the face she reserved for his English crumbled
          like sweet toffee. Because he didn't know how
to say what he wanted to say, no time
          was spent on uneasiness. Chocolate,
caramel and peanuts spoke best, secured
          his place. He hooked his arms through hers as if
they could stroll the lane like an ordinary couple:
          the unassuming black and the Korean whore
in the middle of the Vietnam War.

I had not vomited in so long
Someone put the hex on my true-to-selfness
Some sorcerer kept me far from my guts
The guts I feared would choke me
And make me ashamed of having no wings
And drown my own heart
I know how to survive a feeling
But I forgot that I knew it
A manic forgetter froze my meats
I kept asking for help when I didn't need it
My demons stared out from the ice
When they finally thawed they'd been dead all along
And now I am the walking thawed
You survive yourself if you wait long enough
And vomit your guts down your defrosted breast
And bathe in your mess and say baby it's fine

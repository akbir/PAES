I uproot & save
mental venture
I split the dream
of the slow
& neutral
Persist
& breathe
My little flask
Pointy wisp
Pubescent valve
the game
I smoke
& praise you
& raze you
Jungle
Bulldoze
your sierra
to ash
I wait
& wait
And you
where are you
Fragrant
lantana
your voice
In calm
plains
In silence
Erasing
the thirst
The weightless
insults
the blood
diagonals
& Stand
Go & go
Flower
gaining
Plant your will!

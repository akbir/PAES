Come near, come round,
My dear sisters
My dear brothers.
Come take a peek, and
Have a glance
Someone is claiming to be dead
And she looks like Juliana!
Here we are, straw on straw,
clutching at each one in the dark,
wondering if it's true, and if it's a fact
which is the ugliest in this news.
If what has been is what now is,
Then darkness is here and may never leave.
The pot is broken for the clan
The house is shaken, its fires long dead.
Hear the screaming tornado,
The boastful roaring hurricane:
at the workplace
in the market,
here by the hearth at home.
Esi Boah Bediako Dwemoh
Our beautiful singular Juliana
It's true we shall all die one day,
Did you have to leave this soon?
                        
Dear All-consuming Mother Earth,
Voracious, indiscriminate,
Carnivorous cannibal,
We wish this meat you would spit out,
Offer us back our Juliana:
Beautiful
Winsome
Joyous.
Kind and thoughtful Mrs. Dwemoh
Please listen, and listen good:
If you dreamt
You could skip town
Sneak out of our lives
And disappear,
Happy you'd finished
Your allotted tasks,
Then Mighty Mama, think again.
For us your task if not yet done.
Trainer of trainers
The teachers' teacher
We know why
This noon in the tropics
Schoolrooms are silent
The children abandoned.
The wisest counselor
Accomplished crafter
Sower of hope and joy and peace
You cloaked us in love and habiliments.
Good Mother Juliana
Are you sure you want to leave?
Come near, come round,
My dear sisters
My dear brothers.
Come take a peek, and
Have a glance
Someone is claiming to be dead
And she looks like Juliana!

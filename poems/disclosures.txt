Beneath the writing on the wall
is the writing it was designed
to obscure. The two together
form a third kind
There is no writing   
on the wall's other side
Perhaps this lack
constitutes a fourth kind
Some of the writing on the wall
will be designed as truth
some as art
It is said to represent a mirror
of everyday life in its time
"Fabius Naso
talks through his asshole
and shits out his mouth"
for example
"Foute les Arabes"
for example
Certain words and images
or parts of images
have been chipped away
These often turn up for sale
at sidewalk stalls
before the walls
of other cities
I too have an image for sale
It's the image of a poem
and is to be found
on the reverse of this sheet

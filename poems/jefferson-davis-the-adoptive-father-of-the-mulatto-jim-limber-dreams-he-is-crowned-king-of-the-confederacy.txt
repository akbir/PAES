When Richmond is finally        one of the
world's great capitals I will line the streets
with apple trees         and whenever a gust
of wind sweeps the blossoms from the branches
troops of white petals will rush among the
citizens         and they will be reminded
of the fearful price we         paid for freedom
I will walk with them and be reminded
and have the pleasure of it and be pleased
also by the device         and I will smile
some generations hence the Negro         will
be freed         but his generations will have
tended those trees         and Richmond's Negroes will
vie for the honor of tending them still
I will make Jim prince of those         who tend the
trees and his sons will be princes         but first
I must coin a title         that signifies
a prince         who can never become a king

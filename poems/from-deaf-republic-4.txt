"You must speak not only of great devastation
but of women kissing in the yellow grass!"
I heard this not from a great philosopher
but from my brother Tony
who could do four haircuts in thirteen minutes,
his eyes closed, reciting our National Anthem to the mirror.
"You must drink cucumber vodka and naked sing all night
Unite women and boys of the Earth!"
He played the accordion out of tune in a country
where the only musical instrument is the door.
"Speak not only of great devastation"
so said my brother, who could not write or read
but spent his days covered in other people's hair.

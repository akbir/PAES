At the festival of almost getting there
Zeno pokes his head out halfway, asks
directions, half-heartedly, to the train,
admits he's been riding on the tortoise,
been running after arrows to watch them
stand still. He understands course, path,
way, even relative position (dichotomize,
divide) but motion's still a figment:
distance halved and halved (split infinity,
twin trajectory) the long, long way, and all
that longing (two-fold, doubled) (moments,
instants, continuous or discrete) for some
unfamiliar end--such unforgiving progress,
portioned, yes, bisected. A half-assed effort?
No, he's as good as got it. So much struggle
and amends. Sure, we're goddamned tired of
this much waiting, but look! He's halfway there.

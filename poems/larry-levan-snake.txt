Larry Levan (snake), 2006, by Elia Alba
Hip hip hip hip hip makes the man as the conga, serpentine, slides across the frame
and the disco dub -- tilt and sway --  sewing pelves in the room, as if  Larry, still,
were levitating streetwise Blacks, Drags, Latinos, Punks: Saturday Mass, 1985,
in the Paradise Garage -- Evelyn "Champagne" King, Kraftwerk, Ashra.
No. He's black-and-white, a head shot, one two three four five,
on this S curve of 21st-century revelers, mask on the one body down,
shimmer slant of a hoop earring under the ten-leg- hop-and-pulsate -- 
glide on through. And Larry, Dour Father, bubble pop-popped, afloat,
asking repeatedly: Who, My Friends, is fronting? Who is not?  You,
Velvet Valance, over the sequined drag of curtain. Black is Black,
Brown is Brown, Gay is Gay disco pulsing up and through seventeen years
of not-forbidding bodies. Introibo ad altare Dei. Ad Deum qui laetificat
juventutem meam. Gather you to me and to one another. Grind.

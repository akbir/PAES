two oblong lobes
of rough ice
methane and ammonia
fallen far below
the Kuiper Belt
perturbed by Jupiter
into nearer perihelion
where they warm
the coma sublimes
the tail blurs
a trim probe
relays images from
the twilit surface
as gray and
vacant as sleep
this small craft
a little boat
a dim soul
in an afterlife
in attenuate gravity
in stifling quiet
in the Tuat
to be weighed
against the truth
Thoth and Anubis
at the Scales

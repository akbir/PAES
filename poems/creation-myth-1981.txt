          I was born drunk & paisley, vestige
                       from the womb. My face laughed into itself--
eyes sank into earlobe & nostrils warped into seahorse.
          I was vanilla bean & Mexican vanilla & amniotic
                       dessert, & my mother did everything she could not to devour me.
          I became comino & ajo & hibiscus--
all good for grinding. Mocajete, fist, & knuckle decomposing mass
                       & matter, baby & mother. When she tried to stillbear me it hurt
      until she cried diamonds while my father was swapping spit
                       with the agave.

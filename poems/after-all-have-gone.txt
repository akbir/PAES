I once carried my mollusk tune
All the way to the lottery of gods.
Rain was the old funeral choir
That keened of a hemisphere
Moored under lampwings.
Clouds never left. I knew
The lights would shine clearer
If I closed my eyes, just as
I knew the Pacific would teach
Me to sleep before tying my
Name to the flaming. Here I
Am now at the end of amethyst,
Drizzling another lost sunrise
Inside the quilt of your hand.

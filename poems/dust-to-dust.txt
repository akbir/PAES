Nevermind that keeping ashes
     on the mantel feels ghoulish,
and comically impractical:
not just another thing,
     a miniature memento urn, to dust,
but dust to dust--
I dread the conversational
     Hara-kiri, not, that's what's left
of my brother, but, he died of suicide:
the chasm of silence following the leap--
     so the cremains stay
in the office closet till they migrate
through no will of their own
     to a moving box
I haven't unpacked and likely won't.

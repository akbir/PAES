I remember
the first day,
how I looked down,
hoping you wouldn't see
and when I glanced up,
I saw your smile
shining like a soft light
from deep inside you.
"I'm listening," you encourage us.
"Come on!
Join our conversation,
let us hear your neon certainties,
thorny doubts, tangled angers,"
but for weeks I hid inside.
I read and reread your notes
praising
my writing,
and you whispered,
"We need you
and your stories
and questions
that like a fresh path
will take us to new vistas."
Slowly, your faith grew
into my courage
and for you--
instead of handing you
a note or apple or flowers--
I raised my hand.
I carry your smile
and faith inside like I carry
my dog's face,
my sister's laugh,
creamy melodies,
the softness of sunrise,
steady blessings of stars,
autumn smell of gingerbread,
the security of a sweater on a chilly day.

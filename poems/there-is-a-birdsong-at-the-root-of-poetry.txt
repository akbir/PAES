Hemmed in by an un-
tenable image:
                 feathers planted
below fragile branches 
                 of avian feet            scaly crossroads scoring
a particular blue of sky
                 offending
through the uselessness of misplaced
                  forms                       thorny prongs
that make no sense (and yet belong)
                  on the ground
out of which
                  the bird wings stiffly jut
rigid as
                  rhubarb leaf.
                                                    Should you
kneel the body's aged mechanism
                beneath the shade of dry feathers,
                                                    should you
angle the vulnerable cavern
                of ear--trembling passage to psyche's
                failures   our fall
into suffering                           knowledge--toward the root
                                                    should you
listen        you will hear
                the wasted strains of an underground song
rising from the muffled beak: site of a perverse smothering
                throated core submerged
deadened by thoughtless depths
                but alive
for the dead have kept it
                safe from false music
a ghoulish guard of LOVE
                                                  SAFE from
                Psyche
she who
               bullied by the cruelty of others
the sophistication of fashionable libraries
             the envy of those
who would molest the world into false confessions
and banish                              all mystery
             with their dripping
candles                   she who would
unearth the birdsong                         to cage it
she who                 will end by destroying what she loves most.
           Shhhh, quiet
listen:
it is drawn by other amblers
               its strains awake in our attentions
as a sudden           bewildering              happiness
              ear wedded to earth, listen
and hear
          what those who know all
can not.

Pain trains an undisciplined mind.
I will end yours if  you end mine.
Little feet, little feet are playing
Hopscotch among the landmines.
Hope has worked miracles before.
If  yours didn't, how can mine?
I could have learned to welcome night,
If only  you had been mine.
How dare you put words in God's mouth,
Shail?  Why not. He put ashes in mine.

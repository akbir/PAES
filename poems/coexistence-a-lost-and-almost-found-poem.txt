Over the border the barrier winds,
devouring orchards of various kinds.
Cursed be he that taketh away   
          the landmark of his neighbor.
And all the people shall say, Amen.
The road was blocked in a battle of wills--
as the lame and sightless trudged through the hills.
Cursed be he that maketh the blind   
          to go astray in the way.
And all the people shall say, Amen.
The army has nearly written a poem:
You'll now need a permit just to stay home.
Cursed be he that perverteth the justice   
          due to the stranger (in Scripture).
And all the people shall say, Amen.
Taken away--in the dead of night--
by the secret policeman, who might be a Levite.
Cursed be he that turneth to smite   
          his neighbor in secret murder.
And all the people shall say, Amen--
as peace is sought through depredation,
living together in separation.
Cursed be he that confirmeth not
          the words of this law--to do them.   
And all the people shall say, Amen.

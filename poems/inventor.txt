The jay streaks through the lilacs
                        in color clash.
I note down: Invent
            outdoor birdswing
                                                            so birds drunk
on berries fall off in plaid
            in front of my window.
                                                                        I file it.  After all,
the pussy willow's barely tufted--
                                                                        I have time.
            At the drain, lifting its feet,
                        a Modigliani bird--another invention?
The brook agrees
                        so brookishly, gulping at runoff
                                    like a bear in spring,
            like my husband. He didn't trust my patents:
           
                        the squirrel-free gutter chain
                                    the collapsing arthritic's cane
                        a lever for pulling old stumps
                                                in heavy rain.
But every act harbors a corresponding gadget.
                                    It is that way with God:
adjusting the acorn, locking the tree.
              With the womb, He was clearly Italianate,
the bulbous lines, the excess.
            I often think of Him
                        humming Beatles songs like me, over
                                    six Mason jars of pickling--
my offspring?
                        The dog laughs. You heard it:
a choke, then black gums, a frothing irony.
            He's all wet from rescuing bones
                          from the brook. He drops them in,
                                                                                  then goes in after.
            The brook's rising with bones and I'm afraid
            the electricity will fail. Will the dog
                                  save me with his laughing?
                        That's what this invention's for:
            the automatic rosebush waterer,
                          hooked to the sun and this wheel,
in perpetuity. Once a pirate working
on my outboard told me, Betty, better sand
              trickling in the hourglass than a shifting dune.
                                                       Even the Sudanese
plant borders of aloe against the drifts.
              But I like the look of roses.
              Oh, that's the husband at the door, scratching.
Nights his furry self stands naked
                            before me, until the dog
removes his stuffing.
                                       O bear! Only by opening
              the blinds do I see he's bleeding.
                            It's him, not me, aching
                                        with overdue maternity.
                            A simple drawerful of cobwebs
              kept for emergency does for him,
                            self-sticking,
                                         then together we apprise
                                                                      the chimney,
              holding hands and chatting about the soot stains.
                        That was in winter before he died, the deft
                                                air stealing all we were speaking.
                                                                                                   Yesterday
                          a patent came for my speech retrieval unit,
              an unusual event, even for me, because
                           the government usually can't get
past the drawings. And these were intricate:
              I had the duck by the neck, her feet
                          in food coloring, each step
              inked in. It all made sense--listen
to the ducks now. And just in time for the aspect--
                          ghosts are aspects, aren't they?
              Of all but speech I have memory,
                                          that one sense shy of mimicry.
                           In the spring, now, in fact,
I take the blackfly larvae off rocks
                                                       in the rapids.
               On toast, pre-maggot, the very eggs
                            of mortality, eating them I figure
               I can lure Death itself, a raccoon
washing and washing in the dark,
                            and from there, patent the trap.
            I'll be rich if its works.
                        Works, go the frogs, works, works.

Spout of a leaf,
listen out for the screams
of your relentless audience:
the applause of a waterfall
in the distance,
a hurricane looting
a Miami shopping mall.
How careful you are
with the rain-cradling
curve of your back.
Near your forest,
all are ready to swim
and happy to drown
in me: this lake of fire
that moats the edges.
From my mouth,
they come to peel the flames
and drink their slick throats
into the most silent
of ashes.

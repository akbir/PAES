Imperfect things are always--
it seems--a wave
of some wand away
from perfection.
They're there--the toady
and the bumpy
with warts--for turning
into princes. Even pumpkins--
propped upon
piles of lumber--
idle like unupholstered
carriages up on cinder
blocks. But a trifle's potential--
its capacity for alchemy, actually--
can leave you longing
for lead. So many things
you think are Prince Hals
are really just kings.

Back there then I lived
         across the street from a home
for funerals--afternoons
         I'd look out the shades
& think of the graveyard
         behind Emily Dickinson's house--
how death was no
         concept, but soul
after soul she watched pour
         into the cold
New England ground.
         Maybe it was the sun
of the Mission,
         maybe just being
more young, but it was less
         disquiet than comfort
days the street filled with cars
         for a wake--
children played tag
         out front, while the bodies
snuck in the back. The only hint
         of death those clusters
of cars, lights low
         as talk, idling dark
as the secondhand suits
         that fathers, or sons
now orphans, had rescued
         out of closets, praying
they still fit. Most did. Most
         laughed despite
themselves, shook
         hands & grew hungry
out of habit, evening
         coming on, again--
the home's clock, broke
         like a bone, always
read three. Mornings or dead
         of night, I wondered
who slept there & wrote letters
         I later forgot
I sent my father, now find buoyed up
         among the untidy
tide of his belongings.
         He kept everything
but alive. I have come to know
         sorrow's
not noun
         but verb, something
that, unlike living,
         by doing right
you do less of. The sun
         is too bright.
Your eyes
         adjust, become
like the night. Hands
         covering the face--
its numbers dark
         & unmoving, unlike
the cars that fill & start
         to edge out, quiet
cortege, crawling, half dim, till
         I could not see to see--

I turn over
A new museum leaf
The light is new
And right on the spot
I was just thinking about
A fleet is about to set out
On the ocean light
Water turns to sky
And makes the eye
Blend ingredients in a bend
Shaped like an ear
A new speaker is speaking
I hear the words
They sound along
The halls of the balls
I turn to find them
As if I knew where to turn
Isn't that the sound
That's present
Isn't that the sound
That's gifted
Isn't that something
I'd like to put upon
The walls
And take down
Take apart
And put in a mood
The instructions to which
I say aloud

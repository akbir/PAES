An empire of moss,
          dead yellow, and carapace:
that was the season
          of gnats, amyl nitrate, and goddamn
rain; of the gator in the fake lake rolling
his silverish eyes;
          of vice; of Erotica,
give it up and let
          me have my way. And the gin-soaked dread
that an acronym was festering inside.
Love was a doorknob
          statement, a breakneck goodbye--
and the walk of shame
          without shame, the hair disheveled, curl
of Kools, and desolate birds like ampersands...
I re-did my face
          in the bar bathroom, above
the urinal trough.
          I liked it rough. From behind the stall,
Lady Pearl slurred the words: Don't hold out for love.

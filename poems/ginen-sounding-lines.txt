remember just dad
tied an old tire to
a metal fence pole
so [we] could practice
pitching--o say can you hear
the hollow sound when
the baseball strikes
rubber--the rattling when
it strikes wire--or
that perfect sound--
speak english only--
when [we] strike the pole
through the center of--o
say can you remember
just little league--barrigada
"tigers"--black and gold
uniforms--red seams--
my brother played for father
duenas memorial high school
"friars"--maroon and gold
uniforms--to pledge allegiance--
[we] collected american
baseball cards and cheered
for the "bash brothers"
in "oakland"--near where
brian moved for college blue
skies--thecoliseum was
an island--green and
gold uniforms--white
bases--[we] stand
to sing the national 
anthem--o say
can you see
[us]--what follows
your flag?

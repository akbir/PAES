On the morning of the 20th National Day
my uncle came home and told us:
"All our troops have got into position,
for the Russians may throw an atom-bomb on us today."
After breakfast he returned to the headquarters,
but I had to go to school and join the celebration.
The fear oppressed my back like a bag of sand.
I could not raise the little triangle flag in my hand,
nor could I shout slogans with my classmates.
During the break I called together my best friends
and told them what would occur on this day.
Benli said, "I must go home
and tell my dad to kill all our chickens."
Qingping said, "I must tell my aunt
not to buy a sewing machine.
Who would care about clothes if that happens."
Yimin and I said nothing,
but we knew what we were going to do.
We decided to go to the army,
for we did not want to be roasted at home
like little pigs.

She is proud of her papa
because he comes
to their little grey school,
converted from army barracks,
to teach espanol
to Mrs. Brenda's fifth grade.
And that means they don't
have to listen to that awful
Senora Beister on TV
with her screech owl version
of "Las mananitas" and her annoying
forefinger to the ear,
               Escuchen
and then to the lips,
               y repitan.
He teaches them to order
Coca-Cola en el restauran-
               Senor, quisiera una Coca, por favor-
and the names of all the utensils-
               cuchara, cuchillo, tenedor.
The children look at him funny
when he picks up the knife.
Next week he will demonstrate
the bullfights he watched
in Mexico when he was muy chiquitito.
He will choose a boy to snort, stomp,
charge the red cloth
that Papa will snap
at his side as he dodges
the sharp-horned strike,
stabs invisible swords
into the boy's hide
               and makes the children laugh.

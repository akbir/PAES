Walk through the edges,
circumvent the center.
(Circle the square, so to speak).
Having parted ways with the crossroad,
take each path offered, and unite into
a thousand thousand fragments.
Stutter in the tongues of men and angels.
Spit out the honorific truth:
rave stark as a mad woman.
Destitute, discover the ancestral home
and sit down to fast sumptuously
at the high table.
Comforted, stare into the mirror
that divided all these years,
the mirror that melts in the mouth.
Now, speak clearly.

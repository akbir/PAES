As winter secrets
with the purple
what is revealed
 is electric --
notes tune
 unknown scales,
syntax alters
 tongues,
terracotta melts
 white,
banyan ribbons
 into armatures
as branch-roots
 twist, meeting
soil in a circle.
 Circuits
glazed
 under cloth
 alphabets
for a calligrapher's
italicised
 in invisible ink,
letters never
 posted,
cartographer's
 map, uncharted --
as phrases fold
 so do veils.

Dying only mother's hands continue undying, blading into air, impersonal, forced, curving it down -- drought incessant rain revolution and the organs shutting down but not these extremities, here since I first opened my first eyes first day and there they were, delicate, pointing, will not back off, cannot be remembered. Mother, dying -- mother not wanting to die -- mother scared awakening each night thinking she's dead -- crying out -- mother not remembering who I am as I run in -- who am I -- mother we must take away the phone because who will you call next -- now saying I dreamt I have to get this dress on, if I get this dress on I will not die -- mother who cannot get the dress on because of broken hip and broken arm and tubes and coils and pan and everywhere pain, wandering delirium, in the fetid shadow- world -- geotrauma -- trans- natural -- what is this message you have been scribbling all your life to me, what is this you drag again today into non-being. Draw it. The me who is not here. Who is the ghost in this room. What am I that is now drawn. Where are we heading. Into what do you throw me with your quick eye -- up onto me then down onto the blank of the page. You rip the face off. I see my elbow there where now you bend it with the pen, you fill it in, you slough it off me onto more just-now making of more future. You look back up, you take my strangeness from me, you machine me, you hatch me in. To make what, mother, here in this eternity this second this million years where I watch as each thing is seen and cancelled-out and re- produced -- multiplying aspects of light in the morning air -- the fingers dipping frantic into the bag of pens, pencils, then here they are -- the images -- and the hands move -- they are making a line now, it is our world, it horizons, we ghost, we sleepwalk, everything around us is leveled, canceled, we background, we are barely remains, we remain, but for what, the fingers are deepening curling, bringing it round, the mind does not -- I don't think -- know this but the fingers, oh, for all my life scribbling open the unseen, done with mere things, not interested in appraisal, just seizure -- what is meant by seizure -- all energy, business- serious, about direction, tracing things that dissolve from thingness into in-betweens -- here firm lines, here powdery lift off -- hunger, fear -- the study begins -- all is not lost -- the thought a few seconds wide -- the perusal having gone from here to here, aggregates, thicket, this spot could be where we came in, or where we are saved, could be a mistake, looks across room through me, me not here then, me trying to rise in the beam, nothing I do will make it happen, rock-face, work that excludes everything that is not itself, all urge in the process of becoming all effect, how can I touch that hand like snow moving, when is it time again as here there is no time, or time has been loaded but not cocked, so is held in reserve, all wound up, I was also made but not like this, I look for reluctance, expectation, but those are not the temperatures -- if only I could be in the scene -- my time is not passing -- whose is the time that is passing -- the hands rushing across the paper, cloudy with a sun outside also rushing scribbling -- wisdom turning itself away from wisdom to be -- what -- a thing that would gold-up but cannot, a patch of blue outside suddenly like the cessation of language when lips cease to move -- sun -- self- pronouncing -- I want this to not be my writing of it, want my hands not to be here also, mingling with hers who will not take my hand ever into hers, no matter how late we are, no matter that we have to run so fast through all these people and I need the hand, somewhere a radiant clearing, are we heading for it, head down towards the wide page, hand full of high feeling, cannot tell if it takes or gives, cannot tell what it is that is generating the line, it comes from the long fingers but is not them, all is being spent, the feeling that all -- all that we need or have -- would be spent for this next thing this capture, actually loud though all you can hear is the small scratching, and I feel dusk approaching though it is still early afternoon, just slipping, no one here to see this but me, told loud in silence by arcs, contours, swell of wind, billowing, fluent -- ink chalk charcoal -- sweeps, spirals, the river that goes nowhere, that has survived the astonishments and will never venture close to that heat again, is cool here, looking up at what, looking back down, how is it possible the world still exists, as it begins to take form there, in the not being, there is once then there is the big vocabulary, loosed, like a jay's song thrown down when the bird goes away, cold mornings, hauling dawn away with it, leaving grackle and crow in sun -- they have known what to find in the unmade undrawn unseen unmarked and dragged it into here -- that it be visible.

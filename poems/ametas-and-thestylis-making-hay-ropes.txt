AMETAS
Think'st thou that this love can stand,
Whilst thou still dost say me nay?
Love unpaid does soon disband:
Love binds love as hay binds hay.
THESTYLIS
Think'st thou that this rope would twine
If we both should turn one way?
Where both parties so combine,
Neither love will twist nor hay.
AMETAS
Thus you vain excuses find,
Which yourselves and us delay:
And love ties a woman's mind
Looser than with ropes of hay.
THESTYLIS
What you cannot constant hope
Must be taken as you may.
AMETAS
Then let's both lay by our rope,
And go kiss within the hay.

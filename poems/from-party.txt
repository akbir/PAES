finger family
father the most used
mother obscene
i lift her up
married sister
well fed brother
no common stem
bunker
show shoes
touch and stand
behind others
place hands
take them off
come right in
here is the cure
learning how to hide
from planes
helicopters
turning ships
falling to the ground
drawing
from the lamp hangs sister
swings frightens mother
in the pot dumplings drop
blue is kitchen furniture
the table we cannot reach
even from the chair
she leaps from the lamp
sunny and fence
huge gate mother
angry head father
over him
swollen crows
black magpies
and 2 humps
her face furrowed
grind and bars
in a spotted
costume dancing
to the big butterfly
his end part
dribbles juice
lady cleans up
the slippery floor
do the twist
world's favorite
the african story
our group's as well
i will also tell
them a story but
they will shake
their heads and
my remained mates
leave because
i won't fit
neither here nor there
i'm like the snails
but not sticky
and even stringy
mostly
herma-and-phrodite
i did not decide yet
hesitating
the rainbow comes
after the rain so
i also come out
i'm like the snail
spine freely chosen
to imprint myself
or someone else but
i'm also hosting
i don't think i'm stringy
and my trace is discrete
the rainbow comes
after the rain
i also come out
black marked brush
staining kit in sandpit
unstriped
monkey wet the sand
and lie down cut shiny skin

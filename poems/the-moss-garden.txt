Somewhere outside Kyoto's line, she said,
they stumbled across the famous garden of moss,
the smallish sign so plain it could have been 
overlooked. No temple, only moss. 
So they entered the walkway with little expectation,
the silence creeping in, much like expectation.
Instead of leading them to the garden directly,
two monks had led them to a different task,
requested they copy three hundred characters,
the ink and paper set down for the task.
And this, too, was a practiced form of prayer, 
left behind for those who had forgotten prayer. 
The monks left brushes, ink, and bowls of water. 
They asked the seekers to write, to pray. But prayer, 
any prayer, wasn't easy. The brush and ink,
the doubting hand, made not for simple prayer.
And even as I write this, I do not want to pray.
This story changes nothing; I do not want to pray.

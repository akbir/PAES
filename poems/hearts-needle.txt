V

Winter again and it is snowing;   
Although you are still three,   
You are already growing
Strange to me.

You chatter about new playmates, sing   
Strange songs; you do not know   
Hey ding-a-ding-a-ding
Or where I go

Or when I sang for bedtime, Fox
Went out on a chilly night,
Before I went for walks
And did not write;

You never mind the squalls and storms   
That are renewed long since;
Outside the thick snow swarms
Into my prints

And swirls out by warehouses, sealed,   
Dark cowbarns, huddled, still,
Beyond to the blank field,
The foxâ€™s hill

Where he backtracks and sees the paw,   
Gnawed off, he cannot feel;
Conceded to the jaw
Of toothed, blue steel.

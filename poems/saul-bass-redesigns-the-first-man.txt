To make, you first have
            to create materials. Re: man, we know
the rib removed. But, before -- ?
            Forget ash to ash, dust
                        &c.
                        Stick a floating rib (i.e. thoracic
11-12, y'know -- "Edenic") in a glass
            of  water with the promise
                        it'll grow
            roots like leek or fur
                        like chia. The joke's Crusoe
            astride the bone or   Jim & Huck paddling
rustic as a ballpoint pen will go.
            -- Nn-o.
                       (That's not a plank
                                              in your peeper!) --
           It's a hollow; cue: running
faucet, a Pabst-crack opening
                      into seraphic
           choir. (Risk Handel's?
   A perfect major? root, third, & fifth?) With aesthetics,
                      like a bad comb-
                                            over, you don't
           need a mirror to know what you are
   missing. Now that you have this
                                 thing, you've got to
   feed, roof, & rock-
                      a-bye baby. You're the big boss, head honch-
    o, but watch out, foreman, Little Evie
                      & Adam were the first
organized union. (1-2-3-4    ...    don't give us pain in labor!)
                      So what'll you give him in return?
    Latin and genus?
                      Genius?
                                            . . .  Medicinal plants?
                      (I call this "Vladimir
                                 Nabo-cough," man.)
Or do we let him take for him-
           self   by fount,
fin, & medium -- language. Though from this,
                      we know
           creation is only
myth; destruction, narrative.

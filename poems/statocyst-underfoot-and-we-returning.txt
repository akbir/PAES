The news, descriptive. Rhetoric, void. It's finally here: inarticulate
brachiopods have no matching teeth and sockets
and their valves are held together only by muscles -- 
wherefore the ball to fit the change? unto what did she say, "change is a hard thing"
-- woman thumbs for four pennies -- currency is that which hinges -- 
chain to door swung open
-- the hammocking tree just some yards downhill
bears that crux of certain lightning -- 
stilled, any young boy climbs under -- 
black root tangle -- struck essence rising through each dendrite of tree charred spindle bone of dog buried the summer before, a cave where the trunk cracked wide tree now near-preacher, arms wide-flung, ligature in a voiding smolder
and so, ay-ay!                   hold it -- just
-- we're gonna talk clams for a sec and you'll listen, ear, chamber that cannot refuse -- 
here, quickly: Branchiopoda is not to be confused with brachiopod;
not to be pulled into the question of articulacy. Not a hand
in gesticulating fit. Skin articulates denouement -- 
articulates more French than ever -- articulates joint's claim, that bone.
Boy, tree, you've got some nerve.
And we're back:
inarticulate brachiopods/untoothed hinges/muscles more complex, sure, so  articulate brachiopods/toothed hinges/simple opening/closing muscle--
Lock down and ready, this is barbecue. Speak a word and tooth
that hinge, malign those swinging doors. I'm throwing all the clams in -- 
making each swaddle explain its wrap -- 
in the distance the great tree too dendrite to handle
itself splits in two. To solve this matter of teeth, I try thinking
ribs run the breadth of the body, always away from themselves.

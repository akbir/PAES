Moringa of the flood bed
on the banks of the river Tigris.
A dove on a swaying bough's mournful cooing
has turned me sad,
Her song like the song
of the queen of the gathering--
When she touches her triple chord   
you can forget the maestro brother of the caliph al-Hadi!
And when she sings!--who was Anjash
that camel driver with the mesmerizing chant, anyway?
In Hadimat, Salma's direction,
and Sindad, I swear it,
I'm in love, far gone,
with a girl who lives in Ajyadi.   
Wrong, she lives in the obsidian black
of the membrane of my liver.
Through her, in a rush of musk   
and saffron, beauty falls   
into disarray.

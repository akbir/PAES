is to become a footnote
in a learned work of the
22nd century   not just a
"cf" or a "see" but a sol-
id note such as Raby gives
Walafrid Straho in Christ-
ian Latin Poetry or Ernst
Robert Curtius (the most
erudite German who ever
lived) devotes to Alber-
tino Mussato in his Euro-
paische Literatur und La-
teinisches Mittelalter   I
hope the scholar of the
22nd will lick his schol-
arly lips when he finds me
in some forgotten source
(perhaps the Obloquies of
Dreadful Edward Dahlberg)
and think here is an odd-
ball I would have liked,
immortalizing me in six
turgid lines of footnote.
